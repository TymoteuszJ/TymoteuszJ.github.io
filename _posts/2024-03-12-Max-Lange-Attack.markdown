## Max Lange Attack
# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Lange_Attack)
TheMax Lange Attackis achess openingthat can arise from several different opening lines, including theTwo Knights Defense,Petroff's Defense,Scotch Gambit,Bishop's Opening,Center Game, andGiuoco Piano.[1]Two of the most commonly seenmove ordersare 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 (the Two Knights Defense) 4.d4 exd4 5.0-0 Bc5 6.e5, and 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Bc4 (the Scotch Gambit) Bc5 5.0-0 Nf6 6.e5.
The opening is named for the GermanmasterMax Lange, who suggested it in 1854.[2]
After 6.e5, Black has two main replies. Black's 6...Ng4 isplayable, but rarely seen. More common is 6...d5, when the main line continues 7.exf6 dxc4 8.Re1+ Be6 9.Ng5 Qd5 (9...Qxf6??10.Nxe6 fxe6 11.Qh5+ followed by 12.Qxc5 is a notorious trap) 10.Nc3 Qf5 (10...dxc3?? 11.Qxd5 wins, since 11...Bxd5 is illegal) 11.Nce4 0-0-0 with complex play. Another line for White to try, a critical response, is after 6...d5, White plays 7.Bb5 with strong ideas for both sides, usually resulting in a slight edge for White.
An alternative for White is 8.fxg7 Rg8 9.Bg5, analysed byLev Gutmanand Stefan Bücker inKaissiber, which they consider to be good for White.  Black's usual response is 9...Be7 10.Bxe7 Kxe7.
