One of my favorite openings for white. Please tell what you think of it please.
Also any faults in the opening?
The more critical line would probably be the continuation 5.dxc3 by black, after which I believe the most logical continuation for white is either 6.Nxc3 or 6.O-O cxb2 7.Bxb2, gambiting another pawn similar to the Danish.  In the line you posted, black simply allows white to regain the pawn with a gain of time, which is obviously good for white.  Techinically, it's not even a gambit at that point.
