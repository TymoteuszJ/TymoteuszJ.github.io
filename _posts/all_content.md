## Adelaide Counter-Gambit
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/blog/GM-NiruMalVij/openings-explained-the-adelaide-counter-gambit)

Hello guys! Welcome to a new blog on the series: Chess openings explained! Today I am going to show you to Adelaide counter-gambit which derives from the kings gambit again. The last one, the falkbeer counter-gambit was also from the king's gambit for black. This too is for black. If you want any white openings then you can tell me in the comments below.
Without further adieu, let us get started with this trap!
Before I start, I would like to give a brief introduction about this counter-gambit;
The Adelaide Counter Gambit is a solid attack against theKing’s Gambitfor black and begins with the moves:
1.e4 e52.f4 Nc63.Nf3 f5
When white plays the King’s Gambit they are usually looking to give up material and then have the initiative for the early part of the game. This defense turns the tables on white and gives black multiple attacking lines and control of the center. White has to be careful because if they don’t play properly there are many traps they can fall into. Below are different options they have after 3…f5.
Let us get started with this trap now and I will discuss the variations in this counter-gambit.
The third variation:
So guys, this was all about the Adelaide counter-gambit. Please follow me if you want moreChess Openings Explainedblogs!
Please tell me which opening should I write next in the comments.
Thank you and regards,

The Adelaide Counter Gambit is a solid attack against theKing’s Gambitfor black and begins with the moves:
1.e4 e52.f4 Nc63.Nf3 f5
When white plays the King’s Gambit they are usually looking to give up material and then have the initiative for the early part of the game. This defense turns the tables on white and gives black multiple attacking lines and control of the center. White has to be careful because if they don’t play properly there are many traps they can fall into. Below are different options they have after 3…f5.
4.exf5
This is the main line and best option for white. Black should continue with 4…e4. It keeps black with two central pawns and attacks the knight from white.
White can play Ne5 and exchange knights or play Ng5 and attack black’s pawn on e4. Black from here needs to play Nf6 because d5 in this spot leaves black vulnerable to Qh5+.
The move d5 now controls the center of the board for black and opens up the light squared bishop to attack the pawn on f5. Most of the options white play from here continue with black playing Bxf5.
They could decide not to move their knight and play Qe2. This is an odd move and I would continue with d5. Control the center of the board and let them block off their pieces from developing properly. The pawn is pinned down so the knight can’t be captured but that’s ok.
4.fxe5
This would be a massive mistake for white. Black can take 4…fxe4 and there is nowhere for white’s knight to move. After 5. Ng1 Nxe5 white is down material and is down a tempo. Black has a massive advantage.
4.Nc3
If they don’t take a pawn they might develop to Nc3. Take with 4…fxe4. This ensures you have both central pawns and attacks their knight.
4.d4
You probably won’t see this often but if you do consider yourself lucky as you have unlocked one of chess’s greatest hidden gems. Playing this wild variations is what so many players love about chess. 4…fxe4 is still the strongest continuation and allows for black to fall into the trap of d5. White might think that both sides will exchange knights but black will have the upper hand once the queen gets involved into the game on h4.
The King’s Gambit is my favorite opening and this is my favorite counter to that opening. Try it out and hopefully you will enjoy it as much as I do.

## Albin Counter-Gambit
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Queens-Gambit-Declined-Albin-Countergambit)
The Albin Counter-Gambit offers a 'real' gambit in response to the Queen's Gambit. Black seeks to knock out the d4 pawn and then push his d5 pawn to d4, gaining space.

TheAlbin Countergambitis achess openingthat begins with the moves:
and the usual continuation is:
The opening is agambitand an uncommon response to theQueen's Gambit. In exchange for the sacrificed pawn, Black has a central wedge at d4 and gets some chances for an attack. Often White will try to return the pawn at an opportune moment to gain apositionaladvantage.
In theEncyclopaedia of Chess Openingsthe Albin Countergambit is assigned codes D08 and D09.
Although this opening was originally played by Cavallotti against Salvioli at theMilantournament of 1881,[1]it takes its name fromAdolf Albin, who played it againstEmanuel LaskerinNew York1893. Though it is not played frequently at the master level, RussiangrandmasterAlexander Morozevichmade some successful use of it in the 2000s.[2]
The main line continues 4.Nf3 Nc6 (4...c5 allows 5.e3 because Black no longer has the bishop check) and now White's primary options are 5.a3, 5.Nbd2, and 5.g3. Perhaps White's surest try for an advantage is tofianchettotheir light-squared (king-side) bishop with 5.g3 followed by Bg2 and Nbd2. Black will oftencastlequeenside. A typical continuation is 5.g3 Be6 6.Nbd2 Qd7 7.Bg2 0-0-0 8.0-0 Bh3.
The black pawn on d4 is stronger than it may appear. After 3.dxe5d4the careless move 4.e3?can lead to the Lasker Trap. After 4...Bb4+ 5.Bd2 dxe3!!(sacrificing the bishop) 6.Bxb4??is a blunder—Black continues with 6...exf2+!7.Ke2 (7.Kxf2 does not work because of 7...Qxd1) 7...fxg1=N+!8.Rxg1 Bg4+!and Black wins the queen with a winning position. The Lasker Trap is notable because it features a rare instance of anunderpromotionin practical play.
In the Spassky Variation, White avoids the Lasker Trap by advancing 4.e4. Although Black can captureen passantwith 4...dxe3, the Lasker Trap depends on Black capturing the e-pawn after 4...Bb4+ 5.Bd2, which is not possible here. According toMinev, after 4.e4? Nc6! Black will have the better game.[3]

## Alekhine Defense
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Alekhines-Defense)
Alekhine's Defense is ahypermodernresponse to 1.e4. Black lets White establish a presence in the center with the goal of proving it overextended. Although 1...Nf6 is only Black's eighth-most popular response to 1.e4, it scores as well as some much more common moves like the#3 French (1...e6) and #5 Pirc (1...d6).
TheAlekhine Defenseis1.e4 Nf6. Games almost always continue2.e5 Nd5followed mostly by3.d4 d6. Black's third move is the first little poke at White's center.
White has two main fourth moves in Alekhine's Defense:4.Nf3, the Modern Variation, and4.c4 Nb6, which turns into the Exchange Variation after5.exd6or the Four Pawns Attack after5.f4.
White and Black have the same main goals in each variation: White is trying to hold ground in the center and Black is trying to take it down.
The Modern Variation is White's most popular choice, focusing on development to support the center with pieces. It is called the Modern in comparison to the more classical approach of continuing to place pawns in the center.
Black's main responses are the Main Line4...Bg4, the Alburt Variation4...g6, and the Larsen Variation4...dxe5.
All three moves fight for e5: the Main Line pins one of White's defenders of the square; the Alburt Variation will hit e5 after the ...Bg7 fianchetto; and the Larsen Variation simply captures White's occupant of the square.
After 4.c4 Nb6 5.exd6, Black can and does recapture all three ways, but almost always with one of the pawns. (Although 5...) Black can either keep pawn structure symmetry with5...exd6, or go for imbalance [and a central pawn majority] with5...cxd6. Both moves are about equally popular, with a slight edge to the c-pawn recapture.
The Four Pawns Attack is White's most confrontational response to Alekhine's Defense. Although it establishes a gigantic center, White gives Black much better statistical chances than in the Exchange Variation. The main continuation for Black is5...dxe5, but5...Bf5and5...g6can also be played.
The Four Pawns is also the most important line in Alekhine theory: If it were crushing for White, the entire opening would be dubious, but as things are Black has enough counterplay.
Instead of 2.e5, a beginner may be tempted to protect the e-pawn with2.d3. This is called the Maroczy Variation but it is extremely passive and scores poorly after2...e5by Black.
Black on move two can also play the rather amusing2...Ng8instead of 2...Nd5. This is called the Brooklyn Variation, but it is a bit too provocative to be recommended.
3.c4on move three is the Two Pawns Attack. It usually transposes with White playing 4.d4 next, as4.c5 Nd5performs well for Black, with the d5-knight now untouchable by White's pawns.
3.Nc3was Friedrich Samisch's move. White can recapture either way after 3...Nxc3 but the variation is not very testing of Black's idea behind the opening.
The Modern Variation is White's most successful in addition to most popular. Black's responses to it all score about the same, with a slight edge to the Alburt Variation.
Against the Exchange Variation, 5...exd6 results in many more draws (31%) because it maintains a symmetrical pawn structure. 5...cxd6 is better if Black needs a decisive result.
Although the most common response to the Four Pawns is to capture on e5, Black scores better with5...Bf5(Trifunovic Variation) or5...g6(Fianchetto Variation).
Alexander Alekhinefirst played Alekhine's Defense at Budapest in 1921, scoring a win and a draw, and continued playing it during the 1920s. Alekhine did not create the opening, and games from the 19th century that begin with 1.e4 Nf6 can be found, but his use popularized it.
The opening first appeared in a world championship in 1935, but it wasMax Euweplaying itagainstAlekhine! They drew the game. The only other player to ever use the opening in the classical world championship was GMBobby Fischerin 1972, who scored a famous win over GMBoris Spasskyin Game 13.
GMLev Alburtis one of the few grandmasters in history to use the Alekhine as a main weapon against 1.e4. The opening is also a favorite of Chess.com's NMSam Copeland.
Fischer effectively wrapped up his world title in this marathon of a game, the 13th of the match, drawing the next seven contests before clinching the match in game 21.
For a win with White against the Alekhine, few games are as stunning as GMNigel Short's king walk against GMJan Timmanin 1991.
Alekhine's Defense isn't the most common way for Black to meet 1.e4, but it is effective in the right hands, and logical in its goal of creating targets in the opposing side's center. Study it more in our Chess.comOpening Explorer.

# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alekhine%27s_Defence)
Alekhine's Defenceis achess openingthat begins with the moves:
Blacktempts White's pawns forward to form a broadpawn centre, with plans to undermine and attack the white structure later in the spirit ofhypermoderndefence. White's imposing mass of pawns in the centre often includes pawns on c4, d4, e5, and f4.Grandmaster(GM)Nick de Firmianobserves of Alekhine's Defence inMCO-15(2008), "The game immediately loses any sense of symmetry or balance, which makes the opening a good choice for aggressive fighting players."[1]
TheEncyclopaedia of Chess Openingshas four codes for Alekhine's Defence, B02 through B05:
The opening is named afterAlexander Alekhine, who introduced it in the1921Budapesttournament in games againstEndre Steiner[2]andFritz Sämisch.[3][4]Four years later, the editors of the Fourth Edition ofModern Chess Openings(MCO-4) wrote:
Nothing is more indicative of the iconoclastic conceptions of the 'hypermodern school' than the bizarre defence introduced by Alekhine ... . Although opposing to all tenets of the classical school, Black allows his King's Knight to be driven about the board in the early stages of the game, in the expectation of provoking a weakness in White's centre pawns.[5]
In addition to Alekhine, another early exponent of the defence wasErnst Grünfeld.
Alekhine's Defence was more popular in the past. For instance,Bobby Fischerused it in two games againstBoris Spasskyin theWorld Chess Championship 1972, andViktor Korchnoialso included the defence in hisrepertoire, leading to its respectable reputation.[1]Nowadays, Alekhine's Defence is not so common at the top level. De Firmian observes, "The fashion could quickly change if some champion of the opening takes up the cause, as the results Black has obtained in practice are good."[1]The opening's current highest-rated proponent isGMVassily Ivanchuk, althoughLev Alburtplayed it at grandmaster-level almost exclusively during his career and was responsible for many contributions in both theory and practice. Currently, grandmastersAlexander ShabalovandArtashes Minasianuse the opening with regularity, whileLevon Aronian,Michael Adams, andHikaru Nakamurawill use it on occasion.Magnus Carlsendoes not employ the opening frequently but he has used it occasionally in competitive games, most notably to defeat the formerWorld Chess ChampionVeselin TopalovatLinares 2008.
A game byNapoléon Bonapartefrom the 19th century shows one of the oldest known examples of Alekhine's Defence being employed in a game.[6]Napoléon won the game.[6]
After the usual 2.e5 Nd5, three main variations of Alekhine's Defence use 3.d4, but there are other options for White at this point. Two of the main lines are theExchange Variationand theFour Pawns Attack. The Exchange Variation continues 3.d4 d6 4.c4 Nb6 5.exd6.  White has somespaceadvantage.  Black can capitalise on thehalf-opencentre with ...g6, ...Bg7 with ...Bg4 eventually being played.  The Four Pawns Attack continues 3.d4 d6 4.c4 Nb6 5.f4.  White has a somewhat larger space advantage though the centre is not fixed.  Black has a number of options.  Black can play ...Qd7 with ...0-0-0 and ...f6 putting pressure on White's d-pawn.  Black can play ...Nb4 with ...c5 hoping to exchange the d-pawn.  Finally, Black can play ...Be7 with ...0-0 and ...f6 attacking the centre.  Minor variations include O'Sullivan's Gambit, 3.d4 b5 (intending 4.Bxb5 c5 5.dxc5??Qa5+), and 3.d4 d6 4.Bc4, the Balogh Variation.
The Four Pawns Attack is White's most ambitious line against the Alekhine's, and the variation which perhaps best illustrates the basic idea behind the defence: Black allows White to make severaltempo-gaining attacks on theknightand to erect an apparently imposing pawn centre in the belief that it can later be destroyed. The game can become verysharpsince White must either secure an advantage in space or make use of it before Black succeeds in making a successful strike at it. Black must also play vigorously because passive play will be crushed by the white centre. In addition, while White has built a crushing center, it also becomes undesirable to advance further - c5 can give the Black knight the d5-outpost, while d5 is usually undesirable due to it critically weakening e5. While the main target of Black is d4, the pawn on c4 also can be pressurized considerably via ...Na5. The Four Pawns Attack is not particularly popular because many White players are wary of entering a sharp tactical line which Black may have prepared. The main line continues 5...dxe5 6.fxe5 Nc6 (attacking d4) 7.Be3 (7.Nf3 allows 7...Bg4! when the pressure on d4 is very tough) Bf5 (first developing before ...e6) 8.Nc3 e6 9.Nf3. White now usually plays 9.Nf3 to protect e5, thus preparing a potential d5 advance, and since 9...Bg4!? would cost Black a tempo, though it is still an option for Black, as it adds pressure against d4, though after an exchange with ...Bxf3 gxf3 White would get the bishop-pair and an even stronger center with the f-pawn. The mainline is 9...Be7, preparing ...f6 to break apart White's center. White used to automatically play 10.d5 in response to counter this, which can lead to complex & sharp play. However, a recent development has been 10.Be2 O-O 11.O-O f6 12.exf6 Bxf6 13.Qd2 (preparing Rad1 and also connecting rooks) Qe7 (Black in turn connecting rooks and also preparing ...Rad8) 14.Rad1 Rad8 15.Kh1! which in 1-0 Ray Robson–Daniel Naroditsky, US Championship 2021, led to a win for White in 48 moves.[7]The point of this move is that it prevents the ...e5 push, with the extra point of moving the king out of the a7-g1 diagonal. Black also has a weakness in the form of the isolated e6-pawn, while White still has a space advantage.[8]An alternative move is 9...Qd7, which has become popular recently aiming to castle queenside and attack White's kingside, while 9...Bb4 is another line that tries to be more active than ...Be7, but the c3-knight has little role in the defense and thus the line is less popular than the others.
An alternative is the sharp Planinc Variation (also known as the Cambridge Gambit), 5...g5!?. Black hopes for 6.fxg5?dxe5, wrecking White's centre and pawn structure. The line is named after GMAlbin Planinc, who championed it in the 1970s.[citation needed]It was then taken up in the 1990s bycorrespondenceplayer Michael Schirmer, whose games were noted in a recent book on Alekhine's Defence by British GM and Alekhine exponentNigel Davies.
Alternate moves for Black other than 5...dxe5, are 5...g6 - the Fianchetto Variation, and 5... Bf5 - the Trifunovic Variation.
The Exchange Variation is less ambitious than the Four Pawns Attack. White trades pawns, accepting a more modest spatial advantage. Black's main decision is whether to recapture with the solid  5...exd6, which will lead to a fairly strategic position, or the more ambitious 5...cxd6 when Black has a preponderance of pawns in the centre. The third recapture 5...Qxd6 is also possible since thefork6.c5 can be answered by 6...Qe6+, but the line is considered inferior since Black will sooner or later need to deal with this threat.[9]
In the sharper 5...cxd6 line, Black usually aims to attack and undermine the white pawn on d4, and possibly c4 as well. To do this, a usual plan involves afianchettoof theking bishopto g7, playing the other bishop to g4 to remove a knight on f3 which is a key defender of d4, while black knights on b6 and c6 bear down on the white pawns on c4 and d4. Cox gave the game Jainy Gomes–Guillermo Soppe, São Paulo 2001[10]to illustrate Black's intentions.
A popular setup from White to prevent Black's plan is the Voronezh Variation (namedafter the Russian cityVoronezh, where the line was invented, by players such asGrigory Sanakoev). The Voronezh is defined by the opening sequence 1.e4 Nf6 2.e5 Nd5 3.d4 d6 4.c4 Nb6 5.exd6 cxd6 6.Nc3 g6 7.Be3 Bg7 8.Rc1 0-0 9.b3. White's setup delayskingsidedevelopmentso that Black has trouble developing pieces in a fashion that harasses White's pieces and assails the centre pawns; for instance there is no knight on f3 which can become a target after ...Bg4, and no bishop on d3 which may be a target after ...Nc6–e5. While 9...Nc6?!is Black's most common reply according to ChessBase's database, after 10.d5 Ne5 Black's knight lacks a target, and will soon be chased out with f2–f4, and this line has scored very poorly for Black.[9]The main line in the Voronezh, and the second most common reply, is 9...e5 10.dxe5 dxe5 11.Qxd8 Rxd8 12.c5 N6d7 (This retreat is forced since 12...Nd5?? loses the knight due to the 13.Rd1 pin) when Black must play carefully to unentangle and challenge the white pawn on c5. Other lines against the Voronezh include 9...f5 leading to sharp play. Other solid moves such as 9...e6, ...Bd7, ...Bf5, and ...a5 are possible as well. According to John Cox, the 9...e5 line is adequate, but Black needs to know the line well.[9]
The Voronezh was recommended byJohn Emmsand noted as a big problem byNigel Davies,[11]leading many players to opt for the more solid 5...exd6 line. However, the line offers Black less opportunity for counterplay. In this line Black usually develops the king bishop via ...Be7 and ...Bf6, because Bg5 can be bothersome against a fianchetto setup with ...g6 and ...Bg7, e.g. 6.Nc3 g6 7.Nf3 Bg7 8.Bg5.[9]
Although the 5...exd6 structure resembles the drawishExchange French, Black can make several attempts to imbalance the position. First, Black should play 6...Nc6 against almost any White move to prevent White from establishing an ideal Nc3, Bd3, Nge2 setup. If White attempts this, Black can strike the d3-bishop with ...Nb4. Second, Black should castle and maneuver ...Be7–f6. After sufficient preparation, a common Black plan is to push ...d5. If White replies with c5, Black can respond with the unusual-looking ...Nc8 with the idea to maneuver the knight ...Nc8–e7–f5 to strike at the weak d4-pawn.
The Modern Variation is the most common variation of the Alekhine Defence. As in the Exchange Variation, White accepts a more modest spatial advantage, and hopes to be able to hang on to it. There are a number of possible Black responses:
In most variations, Black can play ...Bg4 totransposeinto the 4...Bg4 line.
The first recorded use of this variation wasCanal–Colle,Karlovy Vary1929. White resigned after Black's 40th move.[15]
Unlike several other sidelines, 4.Bc4 is fairly popular. The line contains some traps that can snare the unwary. For example, 4...dxe5 5.dxe5 Nb6?? loses the queen to 6.Bxf7+!Instead, the main line is 4...Nb6 5.Bb3, when Black has usually played 5...dxe5 6.Qh5 e6 7.dxe5 (the "old main line" according to Cox) or 5...Bf5 when White can among other things try the obstructive pawn sacrifice 6.e6. In either case, White obtains attacking chances, and so Taylor recommends 5...d5 followed by 6...e6 to reach a position akin to theFrench Defence.[16]
The Two Pawns Attack (also known as the Lasker Attack or the Chase Variation[17][18]) is also an ambitious try. White may gain attacking prospects, but it might cost a pawn to do so.[19]White's pawns on c5 and e5 secure a spatial advantage, but the d5-square has been weakened. Unlike the Four Pawns Attack, the white centre is not as fluid and the game takes on a more strategic character.
Aesthetically, 4.c5 looks positionally suspect, since White's pawn advances have severely weakened the d5-square.[20]White's intention is to grab space and mobility so that those strategic deficiencies are of little consequence.
Black must play 4...Nd5, whereupon White will usually challenge the knight with moves like Bc4 and Nc3. Black can defend the knight with ...c6 or ...e6, sometimes playing both. Typically, Black then challenges White's pawns on e5 and c5 with moves like ...d6 and ...b6.
The statistics presented by Cox show this variation scoring poorly for White, with all of Black's main defences scoring at least 50%.[9]
In the Two Knights Variation, White immediately acceptsdoubled pawnsafter 3...Nxc3 for some compensation. After 4.dxc3 this compensation is rapid piece development. Although the line after 4...d6, challenging the e-pawn often can lead to fairly dull positions, the position remains open and Black can quickly succumb with poor defence, for example after 5.Bc4 dxe5?? 6.Bxf7+!, White wins the queen on d8. After 4.bxc3 White's compensation for the doubled pawns is a big centre that can be used as a basis for a kingside attack. The resulting pawn structure leads to position similar to that of the Winawer variation of theFrench Defence.[9]
If Black does not want to defend against White's attacking opportunities against 3...Nxc3 4.dxc3, then 3...e6 is a reasonable alternative that was Alekhine's choice when meeting the Two Knights, and this defence has been advocated by Taylor.[21]If White plays 4.d4, then 4...Nxc3 forces White into the bxc3 line reminiscent of the French. If 4.Nxd5 exd5, Black will quickly dissolve the doubled pawns with ...d6, and the resulting position will tend to be drawish.
InEndre Steiner–Alexander Alekhine, Budapest 1921, the first high level game with the Alekhine Defence, White played 3.d4 d6 4.Bg5. Cox recommends 4...h6 5.Bh4 dxe5 6.dxe5 Bf5, followed by ...Nc6 and ...Ndb4, targeting c2.
Another rare line, but one that scores well in practice is 3.d4 d6 4.Be2, preventing Black from playing 4...Bg4 while retaining the option of making the pawn advance f2–f4.[9]
After 3.c4 Nb6 4.a4 (the Emory Tate line), White can aim at chasing the black knight away followed by a pawn sacrifice that impairs Black's development, for example by 4...d6 5.a5 N6d7 6.e6, but this leaves Black with a strong center and an almost-winning position, though the threat of a5 still looms. Black can prevent this with 4...a5. White's main continuation is to deploy thequeen rookfor duties on the kingside with 5.Ra3, followed by Rg3 at some point when the attack on g7 is supposed to tie Black down from developing the bishop to e7. However, after 5...d6 6.exd6 exd6 7.Rg3 Bf5, Black can carry through with 8...Be7 anyway, since after 9.Rxg7 the rook would be trapped and lost to 9...Bg6 and 10...Bf6.[9]The idea for this unusual early "rook lift" probably originated with the well-known AmericanInternational MasterEmory Tate.[22][23]Women's World Champion GMMariya Muzychuk, World Junior Champion GMLu Shangleiand GM Nazar Firman have experimented with this line and achieved some success with it.[24]
After 2.e5, 2...Nd5 is almost universally played. The two other knight moves that do nothangit to the queen on d1 are 2...Ng8 and 2...Ne4.
Instead of chasing Black's knight, White may defend the e4-pawn, either directly orthrough tactical means.
2.Nc3 is by far White's most common alternative to 2.e5; in fact Cox noted that he saw this move in over half his games with the Alekhine. It is often played by amateurs and those wishing to avoid atheoretical battleon territory more familiar to their opponents. Cox, however, wrote that many White players are bluffing, and in fact know nothing about either theVienna Gameor theFour Knights Game, to which the game can easilytransposeif Black plays 2...e5, citing one book which recommended 2.Nc3 while assuring readers that 2...e5 is uncommon.[9]Another transposition Black may enter is 2...d6, which usually leads to thePirc Defence.
The independent Alekhine line is 2...d5, known as the Scandinavian Variation. After 2...d5, 3.exd5 Nxd5 4.Bc4, 4...Nb6 or 4...Nxc3 is considered roughly equal, while 4...e6 is solid but blocks in the light-squared bishop. 4.g3 has been played by the Danish correspondence player Ove Ekebjaerg, when Harald Keilhack recommends 4...Nxc3 5.bxc3 Qd5! 6.Qf3! (6.Nf3 Qe4+ is awkward in light of 7.Be2 Bh3 or 7.Qe2 Qxc2) Qe6+! 7.Qe2 ("on 7.Be2 or 7.Ne2, 7...Bd7 is unpleasant") Qxe2+ 8.Nxe2 Bd7! 9.Bg2 Bc6 10.0-0 Bxg2 11.Kxg2 Nc6 12.d3 g6 13.Rb1 0-0-0 14.c4 Bg7, when "Black has a rather comfortable position", as in Ekebjaerg–Alcantara Soares, corr. 1989.[29]
More combative after 2...d5 is 3.e5, when Black can choose among 3...d4, 3...Nfd7 (transposing to theSteinitzvariation of theFrench Defenceafter 4.d4 e6, but 4.e6!? is a sharp alternative), 3...Ne4!?, and even 3...Ng8. After 3...d4 can follow 4.Nce2 Ng4, or 4.exf6 dxc3 5.fxg7 cxd2+ leading to quick castling for White.
While most grandmasters play the mainline 2.e5,Jonny Hectorregularly plays 2.Nc3 against the Alekhine, and has scored well against the 2...d5 variation. His ideas have left White with a theoretical edge. Textbook authors of the Alekhine Defence, including Davies, Cox, and Taylor, have therefore encouraged 2...e5 over 2...d5.

## Baltic Defense
# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Defense)
TheBaltic Defense(also known as theGrau Defense, or theSahovic Defense) is achess openingcharacterized by the  moves:
The Baltic is an unusual variation of theQueen's Gambit Declined(QGD). In most defenses to the QGD,  Black has difficulties developing hisqueen bishop. This opening takes a radical approach to the problem by bringing out the queen bishop immediately.
The Baltic has not found widespread acceptance among chess masters, but some world-class players have used it includinggrandmastersPaul KeresandAlexei Shirov.
TheECOcode for the Baltic Defense is D06.
White has several replies to this opening, including 3.Nf3, 3.cxd5, 3.Qb3, and 3.Nc3. Play might continue:

## Benoni Defense
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Benoni-Defense)
The Benoni Defense is a fighting way for Black to respond to White's 1.d4. The Benoni is a common opening among club-level players and an excellent weapon for aggressive players. Although not as common among elite grandmasters, many strong grandmasters have utilized the Benoni throughout their careers. Its most prominent follower was former world champion GMMikhail Tal, who won fantastic attacking games in the opening.
The Benoni Defense is characterized by an early c7-c5 push by Black in response to White's d2-d4. Today, players mostly reach the Benoni via the sequence1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5.
Black immediately creates imbalances in the position, which leads to more decisive games. Black concedes White a space advantage in the center, giving them more freedom to maneuver their pieces. Black gets more active play on the dark squares and an extra queenside pawn that can be dangerous if properly mobilized.
There are quite a few systems Black can choose from to play the Benoni, each leading to a specific kind of game. Below you can see the main variations of the Benoni.
The Old Benoni starts after the moves1.d4 c5. Black immediately plays ...c5 without any preparatory or developing move. If White takes the pawn, Black can regain it without trouble after moves like ...Qa5+, ...Na6, or ...e6. If White advances the d-pawn instead, players reach the main line of the Old Benoni.
As the name indicates, this variation is not as common as it used to be, with players preferring to develop the f-knight before pushing the c-pawn.
The Modern Benoni occurs with the moves1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5. Black develops their f-knight and waits for White's second move before showing their cards. Black's 2...c5 threatens to exchange a wing pawn for White's central d-pawn, so White usually responds with 3.d5.
If White does play 3.d5, they gain space in the center of the board but leave weak dark squares behind. Black can take advantage of these dark-square weaknesses by developing their dark-squared bishop to g7.
The Czech Benoni happens after the moves1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e5. Black plays for a closed, slower game since taking the pawn en passant with 4.dxe6 would give Black a strong center and a slight advantage. The resulting pawn structure will cause both players to have a bad bishop. Black will usually play for the f7-f5 or the b7-b5 break, while White will try to prevent those plans and cramp their opponent's position.

The Snake Benoni starts after the moves1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 c5 4.d5 exd5 5.cxd5 Bd6. Black's 5...Bd6 may seem optically strange, but it allows the dark-squared bishop to control the e5-square. This move makes it more difficult for White to carry out the thematic Benoni e4-e5 break.
Black can maneuver the bishop with Bd6-c7-a5 to pressure White's kingside in this variation. Another plan for Black involves quickly castling, activating the rook with ...Re8, and dropping the bishop back to f8.
TheBenko Gambitis the most popular line of the Benoni, and it starts after the moves1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 b5. Black sacrifices a pawn to get quick and easy development. Black also enjoys good counterplay on the queenside if White decides to accept the gambit.
Many lines and ideas stem from Black's third move. To read more about the Benko Gambit, clickhere.
The Benoni Defense was first analyzed in 1825 by Aaron Reinganum. Reinganum published a book analyzing responses to the Queen's Gambit and King's Gambit. The book was calledBen-Oni oder die Vertheidigungen gegen die Gambitzüge im Schache(Ben-Oni, or the defenses against the Gambit moves in chess).
Reinganum explained that he named the book Ben-Oni, a Hebrew name that means "son of my sorrow" because he wrote about chess to "take refuge from melancholy." Ben-Oni was not related to the opening itself but was the name of his writings about gambits.
In the book, he analyzed Black's 1...c5 as an answer to White's 1.e4. This defense was employed in 1843 byPierre de Saint-Amantin his unofficial world championship match againstHoward Staunton. Saint-Amant later wrote: "This start is not favorable to the second player. Benoni gives a few examples; but it wastes the first player's time, depriving them of all the advantages of a good opening."
Eventually, 1.d4 c5 became known as the Old Benoni. The opening was later improved by masters, who preferred delaying the c7-c5 push. The Benoni then rose to popularity in the 1950s and 60s thanks to the efforts of GMMikhail Tal. Its fighting nature and tactical games made it a popular choice among good tacticians, with players like GMBobby Fischerand GMGarry Kasparovincluding it in their repertoire.
Although not as common in elite-level play as it used to be, the Benoni is very popular among club-level players.

TheBenoni Defense, or simply theBenoni, is achess openingcharacterized by an early reply of ...c5 against White's opening move 1.d4.
The original form of the Benoni, now known as theOld Benoni, is characterized by
This leaves Black a few options such as an early ...f5 and an early dark-squared bishop trade by ...Be7-g5, but has the drawback that White is no longer committed to playing c2-c4 after the response 2.d5. White may prefer to occupy c4 with a knight, or to inconvenience Black's development with an early bishop check on b5.
More commonly, it is reached by the sequence:
Black can then offer a pawnsacrificewith 3...b5 (theBenko Gambit), otherwise 3...e6 is the most common move, leading to theModern Benoni. 3...d6 or 3...g6 are also seen, typicallytransposingto main lines, or to lines of theKing's Indian Defense.
Benoni(or "Ben-Oni")בֶּן־אוֹנִיis an ancient Hebrew name, still occasionally used, meaning "son of my sorrow". It is a reference to the Biblical account of the dyingRachelgiving birth toBenjamin, whom she named Ben-Oni.(Genesis 35:18)
In 1825 Aaron Reinganum, a prominent member of theFrankfurt Jewish community, published a book entitledBen-Oni oder die Vertheidigungen gegen die Gambitzüge im Schachein which he analyzed several defenses to the King's Gambit and the Queen's Gambit, as well as the then unknown opening 1.d4 c5. Reinganum, who studied chess to alleviate hisdepression, conceived the name "Ben-Oni" as a nickname for his writings rather than the name of an opening.[1]
In the 1843Staunton–Saint Amantmatch, Saint Amant met 1.d4 with 1...c5 in the second and fourth games. Saint Amant wrote inLe Palamède(1843): "This opening is not favorable to Black. Bennoni [sic] gives some examples; but it loses time to White, which deprives Black of all the advantages of a good opening."[2]Staunton wrote inThe Chess-Player's Companion(1849): "M. St. Amant derived this somewhat bizarre defense from Benoni. (Benoni, oder Vertheidigungen die Gambitzüge im Schache, &c. Von Aaron Reinganum, Frankfort, 1825.)"[3]Staunton also mentions "Ben-Oni" while commenting on the move 1...c5 inThe Chess-player's Handbook(1847, page 382).
Subsequently, the name "Benoni" came to be associated with the opening 1.d4 c5, and later with 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 and other openings in which Black counters d2–d4 with an early ....c7–c5, without first having played ...d7–d5.
The Old Benoni Defense starts with 1.d4 c5. White usually replies 2.d5 in order to gainspace, as 2.dxc5 e6 leads to no advantage, and 2.e4 transposes to theMorra Gambit, also promisingequalityat best. The Old Benoni may transpose to the Czech Benoni, but there are a few independent variations. This form has never attracted serious interest in high-level play, thoughAlexander AlekhinedefeatedEfim Bogoljubowwith it in one game of their second match, in 1934. The Old Benoni is sometimes called the Blackburne Defense after EnglishmanJoseph Henry Blackburne, the first player known to have used it successfully.[4]
In the Czech Benoni, also known as the Hromadka Benoni, afterKarel Hromádka, Black plays 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e5. The Czech Benoni is moresolidthan the Modern Benoni, but also more passive. Themiddlegamesarising from this line are characterized by much maneuvering; in most lines, Black will look to break with ...b7–b5 or ...f7–f5 after due preparation, while White may play Nc3, e4, h3, Bd3, Nf3, and g4, in order to gain space on thekingsideand prevent ...f5.[5]GrandmasterBen Finegoldoften plays this line; he notably beatMamedyarovin this variation.[6]
The Benko Gambit, also known as the Volga Gambit, begins 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 b5. Play usually continues 4.cxb5 a6 5.bxa6 Bxa6. Black sacrifices a pawn for open lines and long-term positional pressure on the queen's side.
The Modern Benoni, 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e6, is the second most common form of Benoni after theBenko Gambit. Black's intention is to play ...exd5 and create aqueensidepawnmajority, whose advance will be supported by afianchettoedbishop on g7. The combination of these two features differentiates Black's setup from the other Benoni defenses and theKing's Indian Defense, althoughtranspositionsbetween these openings are common.  The Modern Benoni is classified under theECOcodes A60–A79.
The Blumenfeld is a variant of the Modern Benoni beginning 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e6 4.Nf3 b5. While it superficially resembles the Benko Gambit, it has a different strategic goal, that being to initiate counterplay against White's pawn center rather than develop positional pressure on the queen's side.
The Snake Benoni is a variant of the Modern Benoni where the bishop is developed to d6 rather than g7. This opening was invented in 1982 byRolf Olav Martens, who gave it its name because of the sinuous movement of the bishop—in Martens's original concept, Black follows up with 6...Bc7 and sometimes ...Ba5—and because the Swedish word for "snake",orm, was ananagramof his initials.[7]Normunds Miezishas been a regular exponent of this variation.[8]Aside from Martens's plan, 6...0-0 intending ...Re8, ...Bf8 and a potential redeployment of the bishop to g7, has also been tried.[8]White appears to retain the advantage against both setups.[9]

## Birds Opening
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Birds-Opening)
The Bird's Opening is an aggressive flank opening for White. Championed by the English masterHenry Bird, this opening is not popular among the masters of today. However, despite its offbeat quality, the Bird's opening is playable and could be a good surprise weapon for club-level players. The opening also has very little theory, so it can be a good option for players who don't want to study heavy theory.
The Bird's Opening starts after1.f4, when White opens with a flank pawn instead of the more traditional center push of the d- or e-pawns. White's strategy consists of controlling the dark squares on the center of the board. The f-pawn controls the e5-square right away, while a future e2-e3 or c2-c3 push will help White to get a grip of the d4-square.
The downside to White's first move is that the f2-f4 push weakens the a7-g1 diagonal as well as the e1-h4 diagonal. With White usually castling kingside, the open king could be a liability.
There's not much theory behind the Bird's Opening, which is one of the reasons why some players might choose to play it. While it can transpose into other openings like theKing's Gambit, there are still some independent lines. Below you can see the most popular variations of this opening.
The Dutch Variation is the most popular line of the Bird's Opening. It starts after the moves1.f4 d5, which resembles aDutch Defensewith reversed colors. From there, the most popular alternative is for White to eventually play g2-g3 to fianchetto their light-squared bishop to g2.
White can also play e2-e3 instead of g2-g3 in the Dutch Variation. With this setup, White can play a more positional game with an eventual d2-d3 push or go for the Stonewall formation with d2-d4 and c2-c3.
Black may decide to answer the Bird's Opening with the From's Gambit, its most double-edged variation. This line occurs after1.f4 e5when Black offers a pawn for quick development. From there, White can play 2.e4 and enter the King's Gambit or accept the challenge and play 2.fxe5, after which the game gets extremely complicated.
The Bird's Opening came to masters' attention after the English master Henry Bird successfully played it during the second half of the 19th century. Bird demonstrated the opening's attacking potential by defeating strong players of the time, includingEmanuel Lasker,Johannes Zukertort,Louis Paulsen, and more.
Although the opening never caught up in popularity, strong players like GMSavielly Tartakower,Aron Nimzowitsch, and GMBent Larsenplayed it occasionally.
Nowadays, elite players still play the Bird's Opening, even if on rare occasions, including GMsMagnus Carlsen,Hikaru Nakamura,Sergey Karjakin, and more.

Bird's Opening(or theDutch Attack) is achess openingcharacterised by the move:
Named after 19th century English playerHenry Bird, Bird's opening is a standardflank opening. White's strategic ideas involve control of the e5-square, offering good attacking chances at the expense of slightly weakening their ownkingside. Black may challenge White's plan to control e5 immediately by playingFrom's Gambit(1...e5); however, the From Gambit is notoriously double-edged and should only be played after significant study.
TheEncyclopaedia of Chess Openingsassigns two codes for Bird's Opening: A02 (1.f4) and A03 (1.f4 d5).
The opening was mentioned byLuis Ramírez de Lucenain his bookRepetición de Amores y Arte de Ajedrez con Cien Juegos de Partido, published c. 1497. In the mid-nineteenth century the opening was sometimes played byLa BourdonnaisandElijah Williams, among others. The British masterHenry Edward Birdfirst played it in 1855 and continued to do so for the next 40 years.[1]In 1885, theHereford Timesnamed it after him.[2]In the first half of the 20th centuryAron NimzowitschandSavielly Tartakowersometimes played 1.f4.[3]In more recent decades,grandmasterswho have used the Bird's with any regularity includeBent Larsen,Andrew Soltis, Lars Karlsson,[4]Mikhail Gurevich, andHenrik Danielsen.[5]
Black's most common response is 1...d5, when the game can take on the character of aDutch Defence(1.d4 f5) with colours reversed. White will then often eitherfianchettotheirking's bishopwith Nf3, g3, Bg2, and 0–0 with a reversed Leningrad Dutch; adopt aStonewall formationwith pawns on d4, e3, and f4 and attempt akingsideattack; or fianchetto theirqueen's bishopto increase their hold on the e5-square. Another strategy, by analogy with the Ilyin–Zhenevsky variation of the Dutch Defence, involves White playing Nf3, e3, Be2, 0-0, d3 and attempting to achieve the break e3–e4 by various means, e.g. Ne5, Bf3, Qe2 and finally e3–e4, or simply Nc3 followed by e4. Timothy Taylor's book on Bird's Opening suggests as a main line: 1.f4 d5 2.Nf3 g6 3.e3 Bg7 4.Be2 Nf6 5.0-0 0-0 6.d3 c5.
White can also play 2.c4, the Mujannah-Sturm gambit. This is a decent opening and seems to borrow ideas from the Réti Opening (1.Nf3 d5 2.c4) and the Queen's Gambit Accepted. Eventually, this move order is followed by Nf3. The best move in this position is 2...d4, where the game continues in the style of the Réti Opening, with 3.Nf3 being a possible next move. 2.c4 is not a true gambit, since if Black tries to hold on to their pawn, they will be punished (2.c4 dxc4 3.e3 b5?[Black should pursue development instead] 4.a4 c6? 5.axb5 cxb5 6.Qf3, where Black must part with aminor piece, akin to the Queen's Gambit Accepted trap).
Black'ssharpestreply is 1...e5!?,From's Gambit, named for the Danish chess playerMartin Severin From(1828–1895). White then has the option totransposeinto theKing's Gambitwith 2.e4. This is an important option which may cause Black to consider playing a different line if they wish to avoid the King's Gambit. It has been observed that one of the possible disadvantages of From's Gambit is that it is very easy for White to avoid.
If White accepts the gambit with 2.fxe5, Black must choose between the main line 2...d6 and the rather obscure 2...Nc6. After 2...Nc6,International Master(IM) Timothy Taylor, in his 2005 book on the Bird's, recommends 3.Nc3!Nxe5 4.d4 intending 5.e4, rather than 3.Nf3?!g5! when Black stands well.[6]After the normal 2...d6 3.exd6 Bxd6, White must play 4.Nf3, avoiding 4.Nc3??Qh4+ 5.g3 Qxg3+ 6.hxg3 Bxg3checkmate. Then Black again has two alternatives: 4...g5 to drive away White's knight, and 4...Nf6, threatening 5...Ng4 and 6...Nxh2! Futureworld championEmanuel Laskerintroduced 4...g5 in the game Bird–Lasker, Newcastle upon Tyne, 1892, so it is known as "Lasker's Variation".[7]Taylor considers 4...g5 dubious; a quiet response that he considers favourable for White is 5.d4 g4 6.Ne5! (6.Ng5?leads to a dubious piece sacrifice) Bxe5 7.dxe5 Qxd1+ 8.Kxd1 Nc6 9.Nc3! Be6 (9...Nxe5?! 10.Bf4 f6 11.Nd5 Kd8 12.Nxf6!) 10.Bf4 0-0-0+ 11.Ke1 Nge7 12.e3 Ng6 13.Bg5 Rdf8 14.Bf6 Rhg8 15.Be2 Ngxe5 16.Rf1 "with the typical edge for White that is characteristic of this variation", according to Taylor.[8]He also considers the sharper 5.g3 g4 6.Nh4 favourable for White, giving as the main line 6...Ne7 7.d4 Ng6 8.Nxg6 hxg6 9.Qd3 Nc6 (9...Rh5 10.Bg2; 9...Na6 10.c3) 10.c3 (10.Nc3? Nxd4! 11.Qxd4?? Bxg3+ wins White's queen) Bf5 (10...Qe7 11.Bg2! Bd7 12.Nd2 0-0-0 13.Ne4! favoured White in Taylor–Becerra Rivero, Minneapolis 2005) 11.e4 Qe7 12.Bg2 0-0-0 13.Be3. According to Taylor, White has a large advantage in all lines, although play remains extremely sharp, e.g. 13...Rde8 14.Nd2; 13...Rxh2 14.Rxh2 Bxg3+ 15.Kd1 Bxh2 16.exf5! Re8 17.fxg6! Qxe3 18.Qxe3 Rxe3 19.gxf7; or 13...Bd7 (threatening 14...Rxh2!) 14.Bf2![9]
Out of the twenty possible opening moves, 1.f4 ranks sixth in popularity inChessgames.com's database, behind1.e4,1.d4,1.Nf3,1.c4, and1.g3.[15]It is less than one-twentieth as popular as the mirror imageEnglish Opening(1.c4).[15]The move 1.f4 slightly weakens White'sking's position.[16]Chessgames.com's statistics indicate that the opening is not an effective way of preserving White'sfirst-move advantage: as of February 2013, out of 3,872 games with 1.f4, White had won 30.7%, drawn 32%, and lost 37.7%, for a total score of 46.7%.[15][17]White scores much better with the more popular 1.e4 (54.25%), 1.d4 (55.95%), 1.Nf3 (55.8%), 1.c4 (56.3%), and 1.g3 (55.8%), as well as with the less popular 1.b3 (52.5%).[15]
According to the similar site 365chess.com, which includes data for lower-level games, as of August 2015, out of 20,010 games with 1.f4, White had won 35.1%, drawn 25%, and lost 39.9%, for a total score of 47.6%.[18]The five more popular openings are still substantially more successful for White: 1.e4 (53.15%), 1.d4 (54.8%), 1.Nf3 (55.4%), 1.c4 (54.65%), and 1.g3 (54.9%).[18]
At lichess.org, in the 1600-2200 rating range in Rapid, Classical, and Correspondence time controls White wins 50% of the time while losing 45% of the time in the 2,600,000 games in their database. In those games the most common responses to 1.f4 are d5 (41%), e6 (11%), c5 (9%), e5 (7%) and Nf6 (7%). Black's most successful response to Bird's Opening in that rating range is e5, where Black's win percentage is 50-46%, but that evens to 48-48% when White plays 2.fxe5.

## Bishops Opening
# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop%27s_Opening)
TheBishop's Openingis achess openingthat begins with the moves:
White attacks Black's f7-square and prevents Black from advancing the d-pawn to d5. By ignoring the beginner's maxim "developknightsbeforebishops", White leaves their f-pawn unblocked, preserving the possibility of f2–f4.
The f2–f4pushgives the Bishop's Opening an affinity with theKing's Gambitand theVienna Game, two openings that share this characteristic. The Bishop's Opening cantransposeinto either of these openings, and in particular a favorable variation of the King's Gambit, but with care Black can circumvent this. Transpositions into theGiuoco Pianoand theTwo Knights Defenseand other openings are also possible.
TheEncyclopaedia of Chess Openingsassigns the Bishop's Opening the codes C23 and C24.
The Bishop's Opening is one of the oldest openings to be analyzed; it was studied byLucenaandRuy Lopez.  Later it was played byPhilidor.Larsenwas one of the fewgrandmastersto play it often, after first using it at the 1964Interzonaltournament.  Although the Bishop's Opening is uncommon today, it has been used occasionally as a surprise by players such asKasparov.Nunnuses it to avoidPetrov's Defence(1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6),[1]andLékóplayed it in the2007 World ChampionshipagainstKramnik, known to consistently play the Petrov.
Weaver Adamsin his classic workWhite to Play and Winclaimed that the Bishop's Opening was a win for White byforcefrom the second move.[2]He was unable to prove this by defeating players stronger than himself, however, and later abandoned the Bishop's Opening for theVienna Game, making the same claim.[3]GrandmasterNick de Firmian, in the 14th edition ofModern Chess Openings, concludes that the Bishop's Opening leads toequalitywith best play by both sides,[4]and notes that, "Among modern players onlyBent Larsenhas played it much, but even Kasparov gave it a whirl (winning against Bareev)."[5]
Because White's second move makes no direct threat, Black has many possible second-move responses. As shown below, the Bishop's Opening offers opportunities to transpose to several otherOpen Games.
Probably Black's most popular second move is 2...Nf6, forcing White to decide how to defend the e-pawn.

After 3.d3 Black must be careful not to drift into an inferior variation of theKing's Gambit Declined. One continuation that avoids this pitfall is 3...c6 4.Nf3 d5 5.Bb3 Bd6.
White sometimes chooses the Bishop's Opening move order to transpose into theGiuoco Pianowhile preventing Black from playingPetrov's Defense.  For example, 2...Nf6 3.d3 Nc6 4.Nf3 Bc5 reaches the quietGiuoco Pianissimo.
TheUrusov Gambitis named after Russian PrinceSergey Semyonovich Urusov(1827–1897). After 2...Nf6 3.d4 exd4 (3...Nxe4 4.dxe5 gives White some advantage) 4.Nf3, Black can transpose to theTwo Knights Defensewith 4...Nc6, or can decline the gambit with 4...d5 5.exd5 Bb4+ 6.c3 (6.Kf1 is recommended by Michael Goeller, winning a pawn at the expense of castling rights) 6...Qe7+ 7.Be2 dxc3, when 8.bxc3 and 8.Nxc3 both offer approximately equal chances.  Instead, Black can accept the gambit with 4...Nxe4 5.Qxd4 Nf6 (5...Nd6?6.0-0 gives White an overwhelming attack), and White will continue with Nc3, Bg5, Qh4, 0-0-0, and usually intends to meet ...0-0 and ...h6 with the piece sacrifice Bxh6, exposing the black king.  Black has a solid position with no clear weaknesses, but White has attacking chances and piece activity as compensation for the pawn. The Urusov Gambit is also occasionally reached via thePetrov Defenceafter 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.d4 exd4 4.Bc4.
TheBoden–Kieseritzky Gambitis named after English players and chess writersSamuel BodenandLionel Kieseritzky.  Boden published the first analysis of it in 1851. Opening theoreticians consider that after 2...Nf6 3.Nf3 Nxe4 4.Nc3 Nxc3 5.dxc3 f6, White's attack is not quite worth a pawn. The game may continue 6.0-0 Nc6 (not 6...Be7? 7.Nxe5! with a tremendous attack, but 6...d6 is alsoplayable) 7.Nh4 g6 8.f4 f5 9.Nf3 (9.Nxf5? d5!) e4 10.Ng5 (10.Ne5 Qe7! threatening Qc5+ is strong) Bc5+. In practice, Black's lack ofdevelopmentand inability tocastlekingsidecan prove very problematic.
Safer for Black arePaul Morphy's solid 5...c6 6.Nxe5 d5, returning the pawn with equality, and 4...Nc6!?(instead of 4...Nxc3) 5.0-0 (5.Nxe4 d5) Nxc3 6.dxc3 Qe7! when, according toBobby FischerinMy 60 Memorable Games, "White has no compensation for the pawn."[6]
Black can also decline the pawn with 3...Nc6, transposing into theTwo Knights Defense. He must, however, be willing to offer a gambit himself after 4.Ng5. White may invite an offshoot of the Boden–Kieseritzky Gambit with 4.0-0 Nxe4 5.Nc3.
Irregular move orders are 2.Nc3 (Vienna) Nf6 3.Bc4 Nxe4 4.Nf3 and 2.Nf3 Nf6 (Russian or Petrov Defence) 3.Bc4 Nxe4 4.Nc3.

The Classical Defense (also known as theBoi Variation[7]) is Black's symmetrical response, 2...Bc5.
White can then transpose into theVienna Game(3.Nc3) or theGiuoco Piano(3.Nf3 Nc6), or remain in the Bishop's Opening with the Wing Gambit (3.b4) or the Philidor Variation (3.c3). The main line of the Philidor Variation runs: 3.c3 Nf6 4.d4 exd4 5.e5 d5! 6.exf6 dxc4 7.Qh5 0-0 8.Qxc5 Re8+ 9.Ne2 d3 10.Be3. Transpositions into theKing's GambitDeclined and the Giuoco Piano are also possible after 3.d3.
TheWing Gambitresults in positions similar to those in theEvans Gambit. It can transpose into the Evans Gambit, for instance by 3.b4 Bxb4 4.c3 Ba5 5.Nf3 Nc6. It can also lead to the Four Pawns Gambit after 3... Bxb4 4. f4 exf4 5. Nf3 Be7 6. d4 Bh4+ 7. g3 fxg3 8. O-O gxh2+ 9. Kh1
Black's most energetic response to the Philidor Variation is the Lewis Countergambit, 3.c3 d5, named for the English player and authorWilliam Lewis(1787–1870) who published analysis of the line in 1834. Note that 4.exd4 is a mistake because of 4... Bxf2 5. Kxf2 Qh5+ 6. g6 Qxc5.
Among amateurs, 3.Qf3 and 3.Qh5 are also popular, threatening an immediateScholar's mate. But the threat is easily met (e.g. 3.Qh5 Qe7) and the moves are considered inferior since they hamper White's development or leave the queen exposed, leading to loss oftempo. As a well known attack, these moves are mostly blocked by Black, who can smash the whole strategy in one move, like Qe7 or Nh6.
Other Black second moves are rarely played. If Black tries to transpose into theHungarian Defensewith 2...Be7?, then 3.Qh5 wins a pawn.
The Calabrese Countergambit (2...f5?!) is named afterGreco's homeland,Calabria. It is considered dubious, as the line recommended byCarl Jaenisch, 3.d3 Nf6 4.f4 d6 5.Nf3, gives White the advantage. Other analyses, however, have found that the sharp 3.f4! or safe 3.Nc3 are better for White than 3.d3.

Today we will examine the favorite opening of most beginners- 1.e4 e5 2. Bc4 which is the Bishop's Opening.  Of course, most beginners play 2.Bc4 with the sole purpose of playing 3. Qh5 and then 4. Qxf7 checkmate. Pretty quickly we all learn that the Fool's mate doesn't happen too often when you play strong opponents, so we abandon the 3.Qh5 first and then in most of the cases the 2.Bc4 as well and switch to more sophisticated openings.  But 2.Bc4 is a perfectly good move. And even 3.Qh5 can be a good move in certain situation.  Just imagine these moves: 1e4 e5 2 Bc4 Be7?. Here 3. Qh5! is the best move which wins a pawn right away!  The most popular Black's response is 2...Nf6 where White has a choice.  The move 3.Nc3 leads to theVienna Game.  The solid 3.d3 leads in most of the cases to a slow positional struggle.  But what if we play 3.d4?  This move immediately creates some problems for our opponents to solve.  Let's examine Black's possible responses.
If Black captures the e4 pawn by 3...Nxe4 then after 4. dxe5 White creates a strong threat 5.Qd5, which wins a piece right away, due to the threat of checkmate on f7.  By the way, you can notice, that even though this is called the Bishop's Opening, in most of the variations the real star is the White Queen.  We'll see many variations where the Queen decides the game pretty quickly.

# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Knights%27_Tango)
TheBlack Knights' Tango(also known as theMexican Defense,Two Knights' TangoorKevitz–Trajkovic Defense) is achess openingbeginning with the moves:
This position can also be reached bytransposition, for example 1.c4 Nf6, 1.d4 Nc6, or 1.c4 Nc6.
The opening originated in the 1920s, when it was played by both the MexicangrandmasterCarlos Torre(hence the name "Mexican Defense")[1]and the AmericanmasterAlexander Kevitz(the "Kevitz" in "Kevitz–Trajkovic Defense"). Torre used it to defeat then-U.S. Chess ChampionFrank James Marshallin only seven moves.[2]It was later played by the Yugoslav master Mihailo Trajkovic[3][4]and the Soviet grandmasterAnatoly Lutikov.[5][6][7][8]
After decades of obscurity, the opening was revitalized by theInternational MasterGeorgi Orlov, who published a booklet and a book about it in 1992 and 1998, respectively. Orlov rechristened the opening the "Black Knights' Tango".[9]
Since 1992, the opening has been employed by a number of strong grandmasters, includingVictor Bologan,Joel Benjamin,Larry Christiansen, andAlex Yermolinsky.[10]Yermolinsky has even ventured it againstGarry Kasparov.[11]
Although fairly uncommon, the "Tango" has a sounder positional basis than most other offbeat openings: Blackdevelopsquickly, has a flexiblepawn structure, and is prepared to strike back in the center with 3...e5, or with ...e6 and ...d5. The opening has some distinct variations but it is highlytranspositional, and may transpose to theKing's Indian Defense,Nimzo-Indian Defense,Bogo-Indian Defense,Chigorin Defense,Ragozin System,Catalan Opening, andEnglish Opening.
The most common move, preventing 3...e5.[12]Black usually responds with 3...e6, although 3...d6, intending a kind ofOld Indian Defense, is also possible.[12][13]After 3...e6, White can play 4.Nc3 Bb4 (transposing to the Nimzo-Indian Defense);[14][15]4.a3, when Black can either play 4...d5 (reaching a kind of Queen's Gambit Declined or Ragozin System),[16]or 4...d6 preparing 5...e5 or even 5...g6 ("championed by Bologan", according to Palliser), reaching a sort of King's Indian Defense;[17][18]or 4.g3, when Black can transpose to the Catalan Opening with 4...d5, recommended by Palliser[19][20]or 4...Bb4+, preferred by Orlov, which transposes to a Nimzo-Indian after 5.Nc3, or to a Bogo-Indian Defense after 5.Bd2 or 5.Nbd2.[19][21]
This is White's second-most popular move.[22]After the thematic 3...e5, one possibility for White is 4.Nf3, transposing to an English Opening.[23]Palliser recommends 4...e4!?in response, while Orlov prefers 4...exd4 5.Nxd4 Bb4.[23][24]Instead, the main line is 4.d5 Ne7.[25]Now the game may continue in "Tango" fashion, for example with 5.Nf3 Ng6, or transpose to the King's Indian Defense with, for example, 5.Nf3 d6 6.e4 (6.Bg5!?) g6 7.Be2 Bg7 8.0-0 0-0, reaching the main line of the King's Indian by transposition.[26]
Another interesting but relatively unexplored idea is 3...e6, allowing White to play 4.e4 (other moves such as 4.d5, 4.Bg5, 4.a3, 4.f3, and 4.Nf3 are also possible), whereupon Black follows up with 4...d5. From that position, the main possibilities are 5.e5 (the main line), 5.exd5, 5.cxd5, and 5.Bg5. These possibilities can also be reached via transposition from the Mikenas–Carls Variation of the English Opening (1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 e6 3.e4), although if Black wishes to play this way, the optimal move order is 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nc6.
This ambitious move isplayablebut rarely seen.[27]Black normally responds with 3...Ne5. Then after 4.e4 (inviting 4...Nxe4??5.Qd4 winning a knight), Black struck back in the center with 4...Ng6 5.f4 e5 in the seminal gameSämisch–Torre, Moscow 1925.[1]Orlov considers both Torre's fourth and fifth moves inferior, however.[28]He and Palliser both recommend 4...e6 instead,[28][29]after which play can become extremelysharp. For example, Elburg–Simmelink,correspondence1999 continued 5.f4 Ng6 6.Bd3 exd5 7.e5?!Ne4 8.cxd5 Qh4+ 9.g3 Bb4+! 10.Bd2?(Better is 10.Nc3!Nxc3! 11.bxc3 Bxc3+ 12.Bd2 Bxd2+ 13.Qxd2 Qe7 14.Nf3 d6 15.Bb5+! Kf8 16.Qc3 with some practical chances for thesacrificedpawn.)[30]10...Nxg3 11.Nf3 (first diagram) Nxf4! 12.Bf1! (12.Nxh4?? Nxd3#!; 12.Bxb4? Nxd3+ 13.Qxd3 Qxb4+ is hopeless for White.[31]) 12...Bxd2+ 13.Nbxd2 (second diagram; 13.Qxd2? Nxf1+ 14.Nxh4 Nxd2 is winning for Black.) Qh3! 14.Rg1 (White cannot take either of Black's two hanging pieces: 14.Bxh3 Nd3#; 14.hxg3 Qxg3#. Nor is 14.Ng5 Qg2! any better.) 14...Nxf1 left Black with two extra pawns.[32]

## Blackmar-Diemer Gambit
# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackmar%E2%80%93Diemer_Gambit)
TheBlackmar–Diemer Gambit(orBDG) is achess openingcharacterized by the moves:
where White intends to follow up with f3, usually on the fourth move.  White obtains atempoand ahalf-openf-file in return for a pawn, and as with mostgambits, White aims to achieve rapiddevelopmentand active posting of their pieces in order to rapidly build up an attack at the cost of the gambit pawn. It is one of the few gambits available to White after 1.d4.[1]
The Blackmar–Diemer Gambit arose as a development of the earlier Blackmar Gambit, named afterArmand Blackmar, a relatively little-known New Orleans player of the late 19th century who popularized its characteristic moves (1.d4 d5 2.e4 dxe4 3.f3) and was the first player to publish analysis of the opening.[2]The popularity of the original Blackmar Gambit, however, was short-lived, as it was basically unsound, allowing Black to secure a superior position after White's immediate 3.f3 with 3...e5!.  In 1889, Ignatz von Popiel came up with the idea of 3.Nc3, though his main idea was to meet 3...Nf6 with 4.Bg5 (rather than the more usual 4.f3) and provided analysis of theLemberger Counter-Gambit(3.Nc3 e5).
The evolved, modern form of this gambit owes much to the German masterEmil Josef Diemer(1908–1990), who popularized the continuation 3.Nc3 Nf6 and then 4.f3 (when 4...e5? is ineffective as 5.dxe5 hits Black's knight, and after 5...Qxd1+ 6.Kxd1 the knight has to retreat to d7 or g8). The position resulting after 3... Nf6 4.f3 reflects the main line of the gambit accepted, although other Black responses on move three are possible. After many years of analysis, Diemer wrote a book on the opening in the late 1950s, titledVom Ersten Zug An Auf Matt!(Toward Mate From The First Move!), with most of the published analysis devoted to theRyder Gambit(and associatedHalosar Trap), a double-pawn sacrifice characterized by the moves 4...exf3 5.Qxf3.
Thisgambitis considered an aggressive opening, but its soundness continues to be the subject of much debate both on and off the chessboard. Dismissed by many masters on the one hand, and embraced enthusiastically by many amateurs on the other, many consider that Black has good chances of defending successfully and converting the extra pawn in theendgame, while theory suggests that Black has many ways toequalize.  As a result, this opening is almost never seen in top-level play, but enjoys a certain popularity amongclubplayers. Some titled players, including International MasterGary Lane, consider the opening to be suitable at the club level and for young and improving players. In one of hisKeybooks, the Rev Tim Sawyer said, "Stop playing for the endgame, play to end the game! Be a winner. Play the Blackmar–Diemer Gambit!"[3]On the other hand, Sam Collins (in his bookUnderstanding the Chess Openings) noted the tendency for some Blackmar–Diemer fanatics to try to get the opening in every game, thus limiting their chess experience, and concluded, "Nobody who plays good chess plays this line, and nobody who plays good chess ever will."[4]Other dismissive quotes include "playing the Blackmar–Diemer Gambit is like shopping for a tombstone" (Andrew Martin)[5]and "To convince an adherent of the BDG that it is unsound, is like trying to convince a child that there is no Santa Claus." (Kevin Denny).[6]As a result of the intense controversy surrounding the opening, much of the literature on the opening is lacking in objectivity.[7]
GMBoris Avrukhhas written that the gambit "may not be fully correct" but cautioned that he "was surprised at just how potent White's initiative could become". Although he was unable to fully refute the gambit and considered that Black faced a non-trivial defensive task, he felt that with correct play Black could emerge with good chances.[8]GMJoe Gallagherwrote that he had "noticed a common trend among Blackmar–Diemer analysts; once there is no attack and the position looks rather balanced they tend to assess the game as =, forgetting the fact that they are a pawn down." Gallagher thought that the closely related Hübsch Gambit gave an equal game but that the Blackmar–Diemer provided "not really enough compensation" and there were "a number of areas where Black could fight for the advantage." Nevertheless, he cautioned that Black "inaccuracies can be swiftly punished" in the Blackmar–Diemer.[9]IMJohn Coxwrote that the gambit was "objectively weak" but pragmatically recommended that Black should enter the Hübsch gambit instead of accepting the Blackmar–Diemer as "sod's law dictates that [the reader would meet the gambit] in the third Saturday game of a weekender, when few of us are at our sharpest tactically ... one slip sees you getting torched."[10]IM Willy Hendriks notes that the main lines of the Blackmar–Diemer (1.d4 d5 2.e4 dxe4 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.f3 exf3 5.Nxf3) and theKing's Gambit(1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Nf3) have the same engine evaluation, and philosophically wonders whether the two might have swapped places in an alternative history.[11]
It is easy for Black to decline the gambit on the second move with 2...e6 (leading to aFrench Defence) or 2...c6 (leading to aCaro–Kann Defence), although doing so does not eliminate White's ability to offer alternative gambits such as theDiemer–Duhm Gambit(2...e6 3.c4) or theAlapin–Diemer Gambit(2...e6 3.Be3), or for instance 2...c6 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.f3 or 4.Bc4 intending 5.f3.
After 1.d4 d5 2.e4 dxe4 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.f3 exf3 5.Nxf3, Black has five main options:
The line 5...Bf5 (along with most of the ...c6/...Bf5 defences for Black in general) was extensively analysed by Gerhart Gunderam, who published his analysis in a bookBlackmar–Diemer Gambitin 1984.[12]The main response for White is 6.Ne5, intending to attack the black bishop with an advance of the kingside pawns and, if appropriate, weaken Black's kingside pawn structure with Ne5xBg6.  Black can respond with 6...e6, when after 7.g4, 7...Be4 leads to tremendous complications, e.g. after 8.Nxe4 Nxe4 9.Qf3 Qxd4 10.Qxf7+ Kd8 11.Qf4.[13]More common is 7...Bg6, which leads to quieter play, when White's best response is probably 8.Bg2 c6 9.h4, with a sustained kingside initiative in return for the pawn.[14]However, Black also has the option 6...c6 intending 7.g4 Be6, when White has to play accurately to prove enough compensation for the pawn after 8.g5 Nd5 or 8.Bc4 Nd5 9.Qe2 Nd7.[15]White has an alternative in 6.Bd3, directly challenging the bishop, but Christoph Scheerer doubts that White gets enough compensation after 6...Bxd3 7.Qxd3 c6 intending ...e6, ...Nbd7, ...Be7 and ...0-0 with a solid position.[16]
The move 5...Bg4 pins the knight on f3, often with the intention of swapping it off and undermining White's central control.[17]White's best response is to attack the bishop immediately with 6.h3, when play often continues 6...Bxf3 7.Qxf3 c6 (but not 7...Nc6, when 8.Bb5 is good for White).  In this position, White can defend the attacked d-pawn with 8.Qf2 (theCiesielski Variation), but this allows Black an easy game by preparing ...e7–e5, e.g. after 8...Nbd7 9.Bd3 e5.[18]Alternatively, 8.Be3 is theClassical Variation, where White aims for a slow buildup to a kingside offensive.  White's other main alternative is 8.g4!?, theSeidel–Hall Attack, where White is happy to sacrifice the d-pawn in order to gain an increased initiative on the kingside, e.g. after 8...Qxd4 9.Be3 Qe5 10.0-0-0 e6 11.g5.  Black can decline the pawn, e.g. after 8...e6 9.g5 Nd5 10.Bd3, leading to sharp play.[19]Alternatively, after 6.h3, Black can retreat the bishop with 6...Bh5 7.g4 Bg6 8.Ne5, a line which often transposes to the Gunderam Defence line 5...Bf5 6.Ne5 e6 7.g4 Bg6 after a subsequent h3–h4, as White's extra tempo with h3 is not particularly useful.[20]
The 5...e6 line, analysed byMax Euwe, aims to reach a French Defence type position, but with Black having an extra pawn.  Play usually continues 6.Bg5 Be7, when White's most popular option is 7.Bd3.  Black can attack the centre immediately with 7...c5!? here, as recommended by Joe Gallagher and James Rizzitano.[21]Play can continue 8.dxc5 Qa5 9.0-0 Qxc5+ 10.Kh1, when White has to play accurately to prove compensation for the pawn.  Alternatively 7...Nc6 can be considered the main line of this variation, when 8.0-0 Nxd4 9.Kh1 is the notoriousZilbermints Gambit, sacrificing a second pawn in order to increase White's initiative.  The Zilbermints Gambit has scored well in practice, but objectively it probably does not give White enough compensation for two pawns.  However, the alternative 8.a3, despite the loss of time, offers White good compensation for the pawn, and White can also consider 8.Qd2, allowing the trade of the bishop on d3 but avoiding any loss of time.[22]White's main alternative to 7.Bd3 is 7.Qd2, aiming to castle queenside and giving additional support to the d4-pawn, while aiming to launch a kingside offensive with Qd2–f4 and meeting ...h6 with a dangerous Bxh6 sacrifice.  Play can continue 7...0-0 8.0-0-0 (8.Bd3 c5! is better for Black) 8...c5 9.Qf4!? cxd4 10.Rxd4[23]or 7...h6 8.Bh4 (8.Bf4 is also possible, aiming to keep the Bxh6 sacrifice possibility open, but allowing 8...Bb4 9.Bc4 Ne4)[24]8...Ne4 9.Nxe4 Bxh4+ 10.g3 Be7 11.Bg2, when White has some compensation for the pawn but the final verdict on the resulting positions is still yet to be reached.
The Bogoljubov Defence was played by Diemer himself in a game against Bogoljubov.  By fianchettoing the king's bishop Black aims to gain increased pressure against the d4-pawn following a subsequent ...c5.  White's most common response is theStudier Attack, 6.Bc4 Bg7 7.0-0 0-0 8.Qe1, intending Qh4, Bh6 and piling pressure on the kingside, sacrificing pawns at d4 and c2 if appropriate.  However, after Peter Leisebein's 8...Nc6 9.Qh4 Bg4!, it is doubtful if White obtains enough compensation for the pawn against accurate play.[25]An alternative approach is to castle queenside, play Bh6 and then launch the h-pawn against the black kingside.  The best way to carry out this approach is via 6.Bf4, as 6.Bg5 (as played by Bogoljubov in his game against Diemer) is well met by 6...Bg7 7.Qd2 0-0 8.0-0-0 c5!, when Black stands better.[26]If Black tries the same approach against 6.Bf4, i.e. 6...Bg7 7.Qd20-08.0-0-0 c5, then 9.d5 a6 10.d6! gives White good chances.[27]
Black's most critical response to the Blackmar–Diemer Gambit is 5...c6, known as the Ziegler Defence due to Diemer's tendency to name lines after opponents that first played them against him, but most of the theory of the line was established by Gerhart Gunderam, who advocated 5...Bf5.[28]Most modern authors recommend this as Black's antidote to the BDG,[29]sometimes via O'Kelly's move order 4...c6.  The old main line runs 6.Bc4 Bf5 7.0-0 e6 8.Ne5, when Black should avoid 8...Bxc2?! 9.Nxf7!, but instead play 8...Bg6!, when White ends up with very little to show for the lost pawn.[30]More dangerous for Black is 8.Ng5, theAlchemy Variation, where Black has to be careful not to fall for various sacrifices on e6 and f7, but White probably does not get enough compensation for the pawn after 8...Bg6 9.Ne2 Bd6.  German FIDE master Stefan Bücker regards Black as clearly better after 10.Nf4 Bxf4 11.Bxf4 0-0,[31]but Christoph Scheerer believes that White can generate attacking chances with 12.c3 h6 13.Qg4!?.[32]In view of White's problems proving compensation in these lines, ChessCafe.com reviewer Carsten Hansen concluded, "despite all the smoke and mirrors, the Blackmar–Diemer Gambit still isn't viable beyond club-level or rapid-play games".[33]However, Lev Gutman proposed the alternative 7.Bg5 e6 8.Nh4!? Bg6 9.Nxg6 hxg6 10.Qd3, intending to castle queenside and tie Black down to the f7-pawn, promising long-term positional compensation for the pawn.[31]There are currently insufficient practical tests to determine whether it amounts to enough compensation for the lost pawn.[34]Black cannot easily deviate from this line, since after 7...Nbd7 White continues 8.Qe2 e6 9.0-0-0, aiming to launch a strong attack down the e- and f-files, and if 9...Bb4 then 10.d5!.  If White tries to enter this setup after 7...e6 8.Qe2, however, then 8...Bb4! prevents White from safely castling queenside, leaving White with insufficient compensation for the pawn.[34]White also has the dangerous, though probably objectively insufficient, second pawn sacrifice 7.g4, analysed extensively by Stefan Bücker.[31]In the 5...c6 move order White has the alternative 6.Bd3, usually intending to sacrifice a second pawn after 6...Bg4 7.h3 Bxf3 8.Qxf3 Qxd4, leading to sharp complications, though Black can transpose back to the Classical Variation of the Teichmann Defence with 8...e6, since White's only good response is 9.Be3.[35]Black can prevent this 6.Bd3 possibility by using O'Kelly's move order 4...c6.
Alternatively, White can offer a second pawn with 5.Qxf3. Gary Lane argued in 2000 that White has serious problems proving enough compensation for the sacrificed pawns after 5... Qxd4 6. Be3 Qg4 7.Qf2 e5. Black can also decline the pawn with 5...c6 or 5...e6, holding the position.[36]
TheHalosar Trap(named after Hermann Halosar) follows after 6... Qb4 7.0-0-0 Bg4? 8.Nb5! threatening mate with 9.Nxc7#. The black queen cannot capture theknightbecause 8...Qxb5 9.Bxb5+ ischeck, gaining time for the white queen to escape the threat from the bishop. The line continues 8...Na6 9. Qxb7 Qe4 (Black lost inDiemer–Halosar, Baden-Baden 1934, after 9...Rc8 10.Qxa6) 10. Qxa6 Qxe3+ (Worse is 10...Bxd1 11.Kxd1 Rd8+ 12.Bd2 and White is winning, for example 12...Ng4 13.Nxc7+ Kd7 14.Qxa7) 11. Kb1 Qc5 12. Nf3. Burgess wrote that "Although White has some advantage, Black has avoided instant loss".[37]
Many sources recommend the O'Kelly Defence as a means of transposing to the Ziegler Defence while cutting out White's 6.Bd3 possibility, since White has nothing better than 5.Bc4, when 5...exf3 6.Nxf3 Bf5 transposes directly to the 6.Bc4 Bf5 variation of the Ziegler Defence.  Alternatively, 5.Nxe4 is likely to land White in an inferior version of the Fantasy Variation of theCaro–Kann Defence, with equality at best in positions that may not attract Blackmar–Diemer players, 5.fxe4 e5! is good for Black and other bishop moves allow Black to achieve superior versions of standard Blackmar–Diemer Gambit variations.[31][38]4...c6 also has some independent value, for exampleEvgeny Bareevused the continuation 5.f3 b5!? in a game againstNigel Short, achieving a superior position after 6.Bb3 Be6 7.fxe4 b4 8.Nce2 Nxe4, but 8.Na4!? improves for White and may give sufficient compensation for the pawn.[39]Black can also try 5...Bf5, when White must play accurately to prove enough compensation, but probably obtains sufficient play after 6.g4 Bg6 7.g5 Nd5 8.fxe4 Nxc3 9.bxc3.[40]
The Vienna Defence was recommended by Matthias Wahls in his bookModernes Skandinavisch, where he saw it as a refutation of the Blackmar–Diemer Gambit.[41]White can play for compensation for a pawn with 5.fxe4 Nxe4 6.Qf3, when both 6...Nxc3 and 6...Nd6 lead to complicated positions in which Black often tries to return a pawn on b7 in order to catch up on development, and in some cases secure a positional advantage.  White often does best to continue with a gambit policy and simply continue developing.  The main line runs 6...Nd6 7.Bf4 e6 8.0-0-0 c6 9.g4 Bg6 10.Qe3 Be7, when Black is solid, but White retains enough compensation for the pawn.[42]Alternatively, 5.g4 aims to regain the pawn in most cases, e.g. after 5...Bg6 6.g5 Nd5 7.Nxe4 Nc6 8.Bb5 e6 9.Bxc6+ bxc6 10.Ne2 c5 11.dxc5 Nb4, when in a reversal of roles, White has an extra pawn but Black has the initiative and a superior pawn structure.[43]White can use 5.g4 as a gambit option by continuing with 6.h4!?, which leads to sharp play and approximately equal chances.[44]
The push with 4...e3 is often used by strong players to avoid the complications arising from 4...exf3 5.Nxf3, but it is one of Black's weaker options against the Blackmar–Diemer as returning the pawn in this way does not significantly slow down White's initiative, and thus Black struggles to fully equalize in this line.  In most lines White must seek to place a knight on f4 (taking the sting out of ...Nd5) in order to secure an advantage.[45]
The Lemberger Counter-Gambit is an important alternative, where Black counterattacks against the d4-pawn instead of defending the attacked e4-pawn.  White can head for a drawish endgame with 4.dxe5, e.g. 4...Qxd1+ 5.Kxd1 Nc6 6.Nxe4 Nxe5, or 5.Nxd1 Nc6 6.Bf4, with equality and few winning chances for either side.[46]Since these positions typically do not attract gambiteers, White often chooses a riskier response in order to generate winning chances, such as 4.Qh5, 4.Nge2 or 4.Nxe4.  Both 4.Qh5 and 4.Nge2 are well met by 4...Nc6!, when Black has good chances of obtaining an advantage, while against 4.Nxe4 the most critical continuation is 4...Qxd4, when White can continue with either 5.Qe2 or 5.Bd3, with complications and some compensation for the pawn in either case, but it is unclear if it is enough.[47]
3...f5 is an important option for Black, since 4.f3 is well met by 4...e5!, with some advantage for Black.  Instead White does better to prevent ...e5 with 4.Bf4, and then obtain compensation for a pawn with a subsequent f3.[48]3...Bf5 is well met by 4.f3, and if 4...exf3 then 5.Qxf3 attacking the bishop (thus Black may be better off transposing to the Vienna Defence with 4...Nf6).[49]3...c6 and 3...e6 transpose to theCaro–Kann DefenceandFrench Defencerespectively, and in the former case White can continue in Blackmar–Diemer Gambit style with 4.f3 or 4.Bc4 intending 5.f3 (which often transposes to the O'Kelly Defence).  After 3...e6, however, White cannot easily force a Blackmar–Diemer Gambit type position as 4.f3 Bb4 (which also comes up via the French Rubinstein Variation) is very bad for White.
Another option for White is to play the Veresov Opening moves – without 3.Bg5. If Black responds with the Alburt Defence after1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 Bf5it can transpose into a type of BDG Zeller Defence after3. e4 dxe4. A new line only recently mentioned in Tim Sawyer's Blackmar–Diemer Books 5 and 8, is the Torning Gambit which occurs after4. g4 Bg6 5. Qe2!?If Black gets greedy and captures 5...Qxd4, White gets a nice game after 6.Qb5+. Tim Sawyer's books mention several games played by Richard Torning who originally played this gambit in the 1980s. A trap is Richard Torning (1809) – amol52 (1424) [D00] (bullet 18.12.2016): 1.d4 d5 2.Nc3 Bf5 3.e4 dxe4 4.g4 Bg6 5.Qe2 Qxd4 6.Qb5+!? Qd7?? 7.Qxb7 Qc6 8.Qc8#.[50][51]
Gary Danelishen, author ofThe Final Theory of Chess, posted analysis of the Torning Variation online.[52]

## Bogo Indian Defense
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Bogo-Indian-Defense)
In theBogo-Indian Defense, named for GMEfim Bogoljubow, Black develops the kingside quickly. As with mosthypermodernopenings, the "Bogo" (as it is known informally) seeks to fight for central squares with pieces before occupying them with pawns.
The Bogo-Indian begins1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 Bb4+. Variations branch out depending on how White blocks the check.
4.Qd2?? is an embarrassing mouseslip, while 4.Nfd2?! moves an already-developed piece. That leaves three serious moves, one of which, 4.Nc3, transposes into a variation of theNimzo-Indian Defense.
There are a few variations based on the remaining two theoretically-independent moves, 4.Bd2 and 4.Nbd2.
White's most popular move offers a trade of dark-squared bishops. Black has several responses to this move. In order of popularity:
If White does not want to enter the Nimzo-Indian or to develop the bishop to d2,4.Nbd2is played. White usually follows up with 5.a3 to try and pick up the two bishops, where Black can either acquiesce or retreat.
Black has three main responses to 4.Nbd2.
The Bogo-Indian has always been somewhat of a sideline, with theQueen's Indian Defense(3...b6) being more popular as well as transposing into the Queen's Gambit Declined (3...d5). Although it has been played a few times inCandidatestournaments, it has never been seen in aworld championshipmatch.
Bogoljubow himself played it six times with Black, scoring only +1 -3 =2.

TheBogo-Indian Defenceis achess openingcharacterised by the moves:
The position after 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 is common. The traditional move for White here is 3.Nc3, threatening to set up a big pawn centre with 4.e4. However, 3.Nf3 is often played instead as a way of avoiding theNimzo-Indian Defence(which would follow after 3.Nc3 Bb4). After 3.Nf3, Black usually plays 3...b6 (theQueen's Indian Defence) or 3...d5 (transposing to theQueen's Gambit Declined), but can instead play 3...Bb4+, the Bogo-Indian Defence. Databases suggest that the Bogo-Indian is played approximately half as often as the Queen's Indian.
The Bogo-Indian Defence can also arise via the move order 1.d4 e6 2.c4 Bb4+, theKeres Defence.
The Bogo-Indian is classified as E11 by theEncyclopaedia of Chess Openings(ECO).
The Bogo-Indian Defence is named after the Russian-born German masterEfim Bogoljubowwho is believed to have originated the opening and played it regularly in the 1920s. Subsequent prominent players to have adopted the Bogo-Indian includeAron Nimzowitsch,Paul Keres,Tigran Petrosian,Bent Larsen,Vasily Smyslov,Viktor Korchnoi,Ulf Andersson,Michael AdamsandNikita Vitiugov.
White has three viable moves to meet thecheck. 4.Nc3 is atranspositionto theKasparov Variationof the Nimzo-Indian, therefore the main independent variations are 4.Bd2 and 4.Nbd2.
4.Bd2 is the most common line; the bishop on b4 is now threatened and Black must decide how to meet this threat.
4.Nbd2 is an alternative aiming to acquire thebishopfor theknightor forcing Black's bishop to retreat. The downside is that the knight is developed to a square where it blocks the bishop, and d2 is a less active square than c3. The line is described in theGambit Guideas "ambitious". Black's most common replies are 4...b6, 4...0-0, and 4...d5.
This opening can sometimes give rise to theMonticelli Trap.

The shocking move 2...e5 - placing a pawn where it is undefended and can be captured with a subsequent attack on the black Nf6 - is known as the Budapest Defense, or Budapest Gambit. Black displaces the d4 pawn, hoping to develop rapidly and regain the pawn on e5.

TheBudapest Gambit(orBudapest Defence) is achess openingthat begins with the moves:
Despite an early debut in 1896, the Budapest Gambit received attention from leading players only after a win asBlackbyGrandmasterMilan VidmaroverAkiba Rubinsteinin 1918.[2]It enjoyed a rise in popularity in the early 1920s, but nowadays is rarely played at the top level. It experiences a lower percentage ofdrawsthan other main lines, but also a lower overall performance for Black.[3]
After 3.dxe5 Black can try theFajarowicz variation3...Ne4 which concentrates on the rapid development of pieces, but the most common move is 3...Ng4 with three main possibilities for White. TheAdler variation4.Nf3 sees White seeking aspatial advantagein thecentrewith his pieces, notably the important d5-square. TheAlekhine variation4.e4 gives White an important spatial advantage and a strongpawn centre. TheRubinstein variation4.Bf4 leads to an important choice for White, after 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+, between 6.Nbd2 and 6.Nc3. The reply 6.Nbd2 brings a positional game in which White enjoys thebishop pairand tries to break through on thequeenside, while 6.Nc3 keeps thematerialadvantage of a pawn at the cost of a weakening of the whitepawn structure. Black usually looks to have an aggressive game (many lines can shock opponents that do not know the theory) or cripple White's pawn structure.
The Budapest Gambit contains several specificstrategicthemes. After 3.dxe5 Ng4, there is a battle over White's extra pawn on e5, which Black typically attacks with ...Nc6 and (after ...Bc5 or ...Bb4+) ...Qe7, while White often defends it with Bf4, Nf3, and sometimes Qd5. In the 4.Nf3 variation the game can evolve either with Black attacking White'skingsidewith manoeuvres ofrook lifts, or with White attacking Black's kingside with the push f2–f4, in which case Black reacts in the centre against the e3-pawn. In numerous variations the move c4–c5 allows White to gain space and to open prospects for hislight-square bishop. For Black, the check Bf8–b4+ often allows rapid development.
In aChess Notesfeature article, Edward Winter showed that the origins of this opening are not yet entirely elucidated.[4]The first known game with the Budapest Gambit is Adler–Maróczy(played inBudapestin 1896). This game already featured some key aspects of the gambit, such as active play for the black pieces, and White making the typical mistake of moving the queen too early. As the player of the white pieces was not a strong player, the new opening went unnoticed apart from the local experts who had witnessed the game. The HungariansIstván Abonyi,Zsigmond BarászandGyula Breyerfurther developed the opening. Breyer played it in 1916 against the Dutch surgeonJohannes Esserin a small tournament in Budapest. The Austrian player Josef Emil Krejcik played it against Helmer inViennain 1917.Carl Schlechterpublished an optimistic analysis of the gambit in theDeutsche Schachzeitung.[5][6][7]
The first use of the opening against a world-class player was atBerlinin April 1918, a doubleround-robin tournamentwith four players:Akiba Rubinstein,Carl Schlechter,Jacques MiesesandMilan Vidmar. Vidmar had to play Black in the first round against Rubinstein, then ranked the fourth best player in the world with a verypositionalstyle.[8]At a loss for what to play, he sought advice from his friend Abonyi, who showed him the Budapest Gambit and the main ideas the Hungarian players had found. Vidmar followed Abonyi's advice and beat Rubinstein convincingly in just 24 moves.[9]This victory so heartened Vidmar that he went on to win the tournament, while Rubinstein was so demoralised by this defeat that he lost another game against Mieses and drew a third one against Schlechter in the same opening.[5][10]
After this tournament, the gambit finally began to be taken seriously. Top players likeSavielly TartakowerandSiegbert Tarraschstarted to play it. Schlechter published in 1918 the monographDie budapester Verteidigung des Damengambits,[11]which can be considered the first book on this opening. The gambit reached its peak of popularity (around five Budapest Gambits for every thousand games played) around 1920,[12]so much so that many White players adopted the move-order 1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 to avoid it.[13][14]
The leading exponents of 1.d4 started to look for reliable antidotes.Alexander Alekhineshowed how White could get a strong attack with 4.e4 in his games againstIlya Rabinovich(Baden-Baden1925) andAdolf Seitz(Hastings1925–26). But a few weeks later atheme tournamenton the Budapest Gambit was held, in Budapest, and the result was 14½–21½ in Black's favour. Another tournament inSemmeringthe same year saw Alekhine losing toKarl Gilgin his pet line with White against the gambit, so that the e4-line had a mixed reputation.[13]Meanwhile, more positional plans were also developed for White. Rubinstein showed how White could get a small positional advantage with 4.Bf4 Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nbd2, an assessment still valid today. The possibility 6.Nc3 was also considered attractive, as structural weaknesses were not valued as much as a material advantage of one pawn in those days. By the end of the 1920s, despite the invention of the highly originalFajarowicz variation3...Ne4 in 1928, the Budapest Gambit was considered theoretically dubious.[15]
This assessment was left unchanged for decades, as few players at the highest level used the Budapest Gambit and information about games from lesser players could not easily be found. During that time, various responses were developed against the 4.Bf4 line; these included 4...g5, invented byIstván Abonyi, further developed by the masters Bakonyi andDolfi Drimer. The master Kaposztas showed that even when White succeeded in his positional plan, it only meant for Black a worse endgame with drawish tendencies.[notes 1]Two pawn sacrifices were also introduced in the variation with 6.Nbd2 (still in the 4.Bf4 line), based on pawn pushes d7–d6 or f7–f6 and a quick attack against b2.[16]
The Budapest Gambit saw a short-lived revival in 1984–85 whenChess Informantincluded three games (as many as in the previous fifteen years), all played at a high level of competition, and all won by Black.[17]But White players found improvements and even invented a line with 4.e3 and 5.Nh3.[18]In the 21st century, despiteShakhriyar Mamedyarov's successful efforts to rehabilitate the line 4.Bf4 g5, the Budapest Gambit almost never appears at the highest level.[19][20]
The Budapest Gambit has never been widely used as Black by the top-ten chessplayers.Richard Rétiused it five times in the period 1919–26 when he was among the ten best players in the world,[21]but he scored only 1½ points.[22]Savielly Tartakowerused it four times in 1928 when he was the eighth-best player in the world,[23]including thrice in one tournament (Bad Kissingen1928) but he scored only ½ point against world-class opposition:Bogoljubovthen ranked number four in the world,[24]Capablancaranked number two,[25]andRubinsteinranked number seven.[8][26]Rudolf Spielmannused it thrice in 1922–23 when he was about number 9–12 in the world,[27]with a win againstEuwebut defeats againstYatesandSämisch.[28]Nigel Shortplayed the gambit twice in the years 1992–93 when he was number 7–11,[29]scoring only ½ points againstKarpov(then ranked number two[30]) andIvanchuk(then ranked number three[31]).[32]Recently,Mamedyarovused it twice in 2004 (scoring 1½ with a win againstVan Wely) when he was not already among the top-players, and six times in 2008 when he was about number 6–14; he scored five points with wins against former world championKramnik(then ranked number three[33]), and grandmastersTkachievandEljanov, but all six games took place inrapidorblitzevents.[34]
Nicolas Giffard summarises the modern assessment of the Budapest Gambit:[35]
[It is] an old opening, seldom used by champions without having fallen in disgrace. While White has several methods to get a small advantage, this defence is strategically sound. Black gets a good pawn structure and possibilities of attack on the kingside. His problems generally come from the white pressure on the d-column and a lack of space to manoeuvre his pieces.
Boris Avrukhwrites, "The Budapest Gambit is almost a respectable opening; I doubt there is a refutation. Even in the lines where White manages to keep an extra pawn, Black always has a lot of play for it."[36]
In theAlekhine variationWhite does not try to defend his e5-pawn and keep his material advantage, but instead he concentrates on building an imposing pawn centre. This brings her good prospects of a space advantage that may serve as a basis for a future attack on thekingside. However, the extended pawn centre has its drawbacks, as Lalic explains: "White must invest some valuable tempi in protecting her pawn structure, which allows Black to seize the best squares for her minor pieces with excellent prospects for counterplay against the white centre."[37]
Hence in this variation Black lets White build her pawn centre only to undermine it later, a playing philosophy espoused in the teachings of thehypermodern school. The strategic themes are similar to the ones that can be found in other openings like theFour Pawns Attack, theAlekhine Defenceor theGrünfeld Defence.[37]
The "Budapest rook" is a manoeuvre, introduced by theIMDolfi Drimer in 1968,[38]with which Black develops the a8 rook aggressively along the sixthrankusing the moves a7–a5 and therook liftRa8–a6–h6.[39]For example, this can happen in theAdler variationafter the move sequence 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Nf3 Bc5 5.e3 Nc6 6.Be2 Ngxe5 7.Nxe5 Nxe5 8.a3 a5 9.0-0 0-0 10.Nc3 Ra6 11.b3 Rh6.
The rook is then used to support a piece attack against White'scastledking.[40]Black can easily get several pieces around the white king, notably a rook to h6, a queen to h4 and a knight on g4. The queen's arrival on the h4-square is facilitated by the absence of a white knight on the f3-square (that would otherwise cover the h4-square) and of a black knight on the f6-square (that would block the way for the black queen).[40]If White tries to defend with h2–h3, this may allow the Bc8 to be sacrificed at h3 in order to open the h-file.[40]
The Bc5 may not seem particularly useful in this attack, but by eyeing e3 it makes it difficult for White to play f4 to chase away the black knight;[41]furthermore, the attack on e3 is sometimes intensified withmajor piecesdoubling on the e-file. Besides, the Bc5 can sometimes be recycled to the b8–h2diagonalvia Bc5–a7–b8, to apply still more pressure on h2.[42]It can also stay on the a7–g1 diagonal to put pressure on f2, if White pushes e3–e4 at some stage.
The "Budapest rook" was an invigorating innovation of the 1980s, and gave the gambit new life. However, inconveniences arise from delaying d7–d6 in order to allow the lift: the light-square bishop has to wait a long time to develop, and any attack on the Bc5 is potentially annoying for Black (since it means either closing the sixth rank with ...d6/...b6, abandoning the active a7–g1 diagonal, or blocking the rook when deployed to a7). This, in addition to the risk of awkwardness in the king side (a knight on f5 will fork the Rh6 and the Qh4) and the single-mindedness of Black's plan (with nothing to fall back on if the direct attack is repelled), has made some revisit the old lines, where it is instead the king's rook that is developed to h6. The queen's rook can then be retained on thequeenside, and will be well-placed if the b-file opens as a result of Black's Bc5 beingexchangedand recaptured with a b6 pawn.
In most variations Black has the opportunity to play Bb4+, a move whose advisability depends on White's possible answers. If White blocks the check with Nb1–c3 then Black should capture the knight only if White is forced to take back with the pawn, after which theisolated,doubled pawnsare a positional advantage for Black that fully compensates the loss of thebishop pair, and even the gambitted pawn. Due to its immunity to pawn attacks, the c5-square may be used by Black as a stronghold for his pieces. Piece exchanges can be good for Black even if he is a pawn down, as he can hope to exploit the crippled pawn structure in the ending.[43]On the other hand, if White can recapture with a piece, the trade on c3 typically concedes the bishop pair for insufficient compensation.
If White is compelled to play Nb1–d2, it is sometimes a minuscule positional concession, as it makes it harder for this knight to reach its ideal square d5.[44]However, if Black is later compelled to exchange Bxd2, that is advantageous to White who thereby gains the bishop pair.[44]Besides, in some situations the Bb4 could be as misplaced as the Nd2.[44]Finally, if White has to play Bd2, then Black should exchange the bishops only if White is forced to recapture with the Nb1, as a recapture by the Qd1 would still allow the Nb1 to reach the d5-square through Nb1–c3–d5.
For example, in the Alekhine variation, after 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.e4 Nxe5 5.f4 Ng6 6.Nf3, the move 6...Bb4+ (see diagram) is good because White has no good reply apart from 7.Nc3. Indeed, 7.Nbd2?just loses a pawn after 7...Nxf4 whereas 7.Bd2?!Qe7!causes White great problems: both the f4 and e4 pawns are attacked, and 8.Bxb4 Qxb4+ results in a double attack against b2 and f4.[45]After 7.Nc3 Black can either answer with 7...Bxc3+ 8.bxc3 or with 7...Qf6, simultaneously attacking c3 and f4.[notes 2]
In theAdler variation 3...Ng4 4.Nf3, after White has moved f2–f4, the e3-pawn becomes abackward pawnon anopen file. Black can then apply pressure on the e-file in general, against the e3-pawn and the e4-square in particular. Typical moves in this plan would include the manoeuvre Ne5–d7–f6, followed by putting the heavy pieces on the e-file with Rf8–e8 and Qd8–e7 (see diagram).[46]The Bc5 is already well placed to pressure the e3-pawn. Depending on circumstances, the Bc8 may be involved either on b7 or on f5, in both cases to assert control over the central e4-square.
This plan is viable only if certain conditions are met. The d7-square must be available for the Ne5, so that it can later transfer to f6. White should also not be able to easily advance the e3-pawn to e4, where it would be adequately defended by the Nc3 and a possible Bf3.[46]Finally, White should not have the time to launch a quick attack on Black's castled position with the pawn thrust f4–f5–f6.
In the main lines the pawn push c4–c5 often brings positional gains to White. In theRubinstein variation 3...Ng4 4.Bf4with4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.a3, after 7...Ngxe5 8.Nxe5 Nxe5 9.e3 Bxd2+ 10.Qxd2 (see diagram) White gets thebishop pairand a space advantage. In order to build up on these potential advantages, the most common plan is to perform aminority attackon the queenside, with the goal of performing the pawn advance c4–c5 in favourable conditions.[47]This push can yield several advantages to White: it enhances the prospects of thelight-square bishop, it creates ahalf-open fileto attack with the rooks, and it creates anisolated,backward pawnon d6 after the exchange c5xd6.[47]
For example, in the adjacent diagram, after the natural but mistaken 10...0-0?! White can immediately realise his strategic goal with 11.c5![48]Then if Black accepts the temporary sacrifice after 11...Qxc5 12.Rc1 Qd6 13.Qxd6 cxd6 14.Rd1 White gets his pawn back and has created a weak pawn in d7, while if Black declines the pawn he has difficulties in developing his queenside (for example 11...d6 might be followed by 12.cxd6 Qxd6 13.Qxd6 cxd6 and the pawn on d6 is weak).[48]Therefore, Black generally tries to hinder the c4–c5 push with moves like d7–d6, b7–b6 or Rf8–d8 (if this creates a hiddenvis-à-visbetween the Rd8 and the Qd2).[47]
Similarly, in theRubinstein variation 3...Ng4 4.Bf4with4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nc3, after 6...Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 White is saddled with doubled pawns in c3 and c4 that limit the scope of his bishop pair. Hence the push c4–c5 can be used to free the light-squared bishop and disrupt Black's position.[49]
In theAdler variation 3...Ng4 4.Nf3, after 4...Bc5 5.e3 Nc6 6.Be2 0-0 7.0-0 Re8 8.Nc3 Ngxe5 9.b3 a5 10.Bb2 Nxf3+ Bxf3 Ne5 12.Be2 Ra6 13.Qd5 Qe7 14.Ne4 Ba7 White has good reasons to push 15.c5.[50]This move would close the diagonal of the Ba7. It would make it harder for Black to develop the Bc8 as pawn pushes like b7–b6 or d7–d6 may be answered respectively by cxb6 or cxd6, creating a weak pawn for Black. Also, the prospects of the Be2 would be enhanced.
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Bf4 Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.a3 Ngxe5 8.axb4 Nd3#
The Kieninger Trap is named afterGeorg Kieningerwho used it in an offhand game against Godai at Vienna in 1925.[51]It occurs in theRubinstein variation 3...Ng4 4.Bf4with4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.a3. White attacks the bishop on b4, but instead of moving it, Black can regain the gambit pawn and set atrapwith 7...Ngxe5 (see diagram). White cannot capture the bishop with 8.axb4??because Black would respond 8...Nd3mate; and the same is true if White first exchanges knights on e5.
A similar tactic has also occurred in aminiaturein the Fajarowicz variation, after the moves 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ne4 4.Qc2 Bb4+ 5.Nd2 d5 6.exd6 Bf5 7.Qa4+ Nc6 8.a3 Nc5 9.dxc7 Qe7! when White, trying to save his queen, fell into 10.Qd1 Nd3 mate.[52]
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Nf3
The Adler variation is named after the game Adler–Maróczy, played at the 1896 Budapest tournament.[53][54]White is ready to return the e5-pawn in order to develop his pieces on their best squares, i.e. the d5-square for the Nb1, the f3-square for the Ng1 and the a1–h8 diagonal for the Bc1.
Black can try the minor line 4...Nc6 that delays the development of itsdark-square bishop, to develop it along the a1–h8 diagonal instead of the a3–f8 diagonal, depending on the circumstances. But the main line is4...Bc5to attack the f2-pawn, forcing5.e3, blocking in White's bishop on c1, so that after5...Nc6White will not have enough pieces to protect his e5-pawn in the long run. Placing the bishop on the c5-square also has subtler points, as Tseitlin explains:[55]
At first sight the bishop on c5 lacks prospects, being held at bay by the pawn on e3, and is insecure in view of the threat to exchange it by Nc3–a4/e4. In reality, posting the bishop here has a deep strategic significance. It holds up the advance of the e- and the f-pawns (assuming the white bishop will go to b2), and thereby secures e5 as a future knight outpost, which in turn restricts the activity of both White's bishops. As to the exchanging threat, the bishop may conveniently retreat on a7 or f8, or even in some cases remain on c5 with support from a pawn on b6.
An important theoretical decision for White is to choose whether to play a2–a3. While this move protects the b4 square and threatens the pawn advance b2–b4, it encourages Black's rook lift Ra8–a6–h6. As Lalic puts it:
It was not so long ago that 8.a3, with the obvious intention of expanding with b2–b4, was the standard move. However, after Black responds with the logical a7–a5, it became apparent in tournament practice that the inclusion of these moves is in fact in Black's favour, as it gives his queen's rook access into play via the a6-square.
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Nf3 Bc5 5.e3 Nc6 6.a3
The opinion of the move 6.a3 has gradually shifted from being the main continuation to being a possible continuation, then down to its present status of being considered a mistake. The threat to push b2–b4 must be taken seriously by Black, who typically answers6...a5. But in the 1980s it was discovered that the push a7–a5 was actually a very useful one for Black, as it allows the Ra8 to be developed along the sixth rank. Meanwhile, the push a2–a3 is less useful for White, as he will not be able to easily push b2–b4. As Tseitlin puts it, "the point is that 6...a5 fits into the plan of attacking White's kingside, whereas 6.a3 does little in the way of defending it".[56]Thus if White does not find a clear way to make good use of his move a2–a3, it may turn out to be a critical waste oftempo.[57][58]
After the topical moves7.b3 0-0 8.Bb2 Re8 9.Nc3 Ngxe5 10.Nxe5 Nxe5 11.Be2Black has regained the invested pawn. White has a space advantage in the centre and can initiate pressure here or on the queenside by pawn pushes like b3–b4 and c4–c5 (possibly supported by a knight on the d5-square). Meanwhile, the white king lacks defenders so Black can start a pieces-driven attack with therook lift11...Ra6(see section "Budapest rook"). The stem game continued with12.Nd5 Rh6 13.Bd4 d6 14.Ra2 Bf5 15.Bxc5 dxc5and Black won in 26 moves.[59]To avoid such an unfavourable development, White players have changed the move-order to keep the Bc1 on its original square as long as possible, so that it can help the defence. Thus, the typical move-order became 7.b3 0-0 8.Nc3 Re8 9.Be2 Ngxe5 10.Nxe5 Nxe5 11.0-0 when 11...Ra6 would be met with 12.Nd5 Rh6 13.e4 immediately attacking the maveric rook. So Black usually opts for 11...d6, forgetting about the Ra8–a6–h6 manoeuvre. After 12.Bb2ECOconsiders the situation as favourable to White, but Tseitlin thinks Black still has a lot of possibilities (e.g. the other rook lift Re8–e6–h6), so that "the struggle still lies ahead".[60]
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Nf3 Bc5 5.e3 Nc6
By refraining from the advance a2-a3 White tries to gain a tempo on the lines of the previous section, making it more difficult for Black to initiate the Re8–e6–h6 or Ra8–a6–h6 lifts. After the moves6.Be2 0-0 7.0-0 Re8 8.Nc3 Ngxe5 9.Nxe5 Nxe5White has tried two different plans.
The older one sees White attack in the centre with moves like b2–b3, Bc1–b2, Qd1–d5, Nc3–e4 and c4–c5. White gets an important space advantage in the centre, but Black can attack the kingside with rook lifts. After 10.b3 a5 White can try to capture the Bc5 with 11.Na4 or 11.Ne4, one point being that the retreat 11...Ba7 would lock the Ra8 because Black has not played Ra8–a6 already. Lalic still thinks 11...Ba7 is the right move after 11.Ne4 due to the importance of the a7–g1 diagonal, but Black can also reroute the bishop with 11...Bf8 and "White has no obvious path to even a minute advantage".[61]After 11.Na4 Black can also simply react by 11...b6 when the loss of the bishop pair is compensated by the semi-open b-file and improved control of the central squares.[62]Tseitlin considers that after the exchange on c5 Black has the better position.[63]Hence the main continuation is 11.Bb2, keeping the knight jumps for later. Then the most common plan for Black is a rook lift: the plan Ra8–a6–h6 was tried in the much-commented gameÅkesson–Tagnon (Berlin Open 1984). Black duly won, but after the game continuation 11...Ra6 12.Qd5! Qe7 13.Ne4 Ba7 14.c5 Rg6 15.Rac1 Bb8 16.f4 authors do not agree on which side had the advantage. Borik and Tseitlin both consider White to have a positional advantage, with Tseitlin recommending instead 15...Nc6!, with dangerous threats.[64][65]However Lalic writes of 15...Bb8, "it is true that the bishop pair looks a bit pathetic lined up on the back rank just now, but there is no way to stop them breaking out later".[42]
The second plan for White, unveiled bySpasskyin 1990, aims at a kingsideblitzkriegwith moves like Kg1–h1, f2–f4, Be2–d3 and Qd1–h5. In the original game Black did not fathom White's idea, so that after 10.Kh1 a5?! 11.f4 Nc6 12.Bd3 d6 13.Qh5! h6 14.Rf3 Black's pieces were ill-placed to counter White's attack.[66]A more principled plan for Black is to react in the centre, specifically targeting the backward e3-pawn and e4-square. After 10.Kh1 d6 11.f4 Nd7! 12.Bd3 Nf6 13.Qf3 Ng4 14.Nd1 f5! and Black has succeeded in inhibiting White's e3–e4 expansion .[67]As Black was doing fine with the 11.f4 move-order, White has been searching for a new path with 10.Kh1 d6 11.Na4!?b6! 12.Bd2 a5 13.Nxc5 bxc5 14.f4 Nd7 15.Bf3 whenJeremy Silmanprefers White.[68]White has even dared the immediate 10.f4 Nc6 11.Bd3 when it is extremely dangerous for Black to take the offered e3-pawn, as White gets a fierce kingside attack for free.[58]
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Bf4
This move sequence is called the "Rubinstein variation" in reference to the famous gameRubinstein–Vidmar(Berlin 1918) when 4.Bf4 was first employed.[54][69]Various authors consider this move to be the most dangerous for Black.[58]It aims to answer 4...Bc5 with 5.e3 without blocking the Bc1, contrary to what happens in the Adler variation 4.Nf3. Another point is that in the Adler variation White faces the risk of a strong attack against his kingside (see section "Budapest rook"), while in the 4.Bf4 variation this is seldom the case because the Bf4 is well placed to protect White's kingside. On the other hand, the early development of the bishop means that White is more vulnerable to the check Bf8–b4+, the b2-pawn is not defended, and in some rare cases the Bf4 can become subject to attack.
Apart from the sideline 4...g5, the main line continues with both players developing their pieces around the e5-pawn with 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ when White has an important choice between the moves 6.Nc3 and 6.Nbd2, each leading to extremely different play. With 6.Nc3 White acquiesces to the breakup of his queenside pawns in return for a material advantage of one pawn, the bishop pair and active play in the centre. With 6.Nbd2 White gives back the gambited pawn to keep a healthy pawn structure and acquire thebishop pair. After 6.Nbd2 Qe7 White generally plays 7.a3 to force the immediate exchange of bishop for knight, gaining the bishop pair, a spatial advantage and chances for a minority attack on the queenside. White can also try 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.e3 to win a tempo over the 7.a3 variation, though he may end up with the exchange at d2 made in less favourable circumstances, or not at all. The maverick gambit 6...f6 also exists.[70]
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Bf4 g5
The sideline 4...g5!? was not well regarded until the end of the 20th century.[notes 3]It weakens several squares—particularly f5 and h5—as they cannot be covered by the g-pawn any more. White can try to exploit these weaknesses with the manoeuvres Bf4–d2–c3 (pressure along the diagonal a1–h8), Ng1–e2–g3–h5 (pressure against the squares f6 and g7) and h2–h4 (to open the h-file). Nonetheless, the 4...g5 line has found new supporters in recent years thanks to black wins against both 5.Bg3 and 5.Bd2.[71][72]
For years, the reaction 5.Bg3 was not well considered, because the retreat does not make the most out of Black's provocative fourth move; as Tseitlin points out, "the bishop is in danger of staying out of play for a long time".[73]But later Lalic found that 5.Bg3 was "just as effective" as 5.Bd2.[74]Black concentrates on capturing the e5-pawn while White tries to get an advantage from the weakening of the black kingside. After the typical moves 5...Bg7 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Nc3 Ngxe5 8.Nxe5 Nxe5 9.e3 d6 Lalic considers the best try to be 10.c5!, sacrificing a pawn to weaken Black's control on the e5-square and expose the black king further. White has also tried to quickly open the h-file with 7.h4 Ngxe5 8.Nxe5 Nxe5 9.e3 but after 9...g4! Black succeeds in keeping the file closed.[75]
The alternative to 5.Bg3 is5.Bd2to place the bishop on the wide-open diagonal a1–h8, after which "White can expect a safe advantage".[74]Then according to Lalic, delaying the recapture with 5...Bg7 6.Bc3 Nc6 7.e3 Ngxe5 is not correct as White can gain an advantage by 8.h4 or 8.Qh5,[76]so the immediate5...Nxe5is better. For some time 6.Bc3 was well considered because Black had problems dealing with various positional threats, but the correct way for Black was found in 5...Nxe5 6.Bc3 Qe7 7.e3 Rg8! 8.Nf3 Nbc6 9.Be2 d6 10.Nd4 Bd7 11.b4 g4 with good counterplay for Black on the kingside.[77]White's efforts then switched to6.Nf3to open the e-file, something that Black cannot really avoid, as 6...Bg7 7.Nxe5 Bxe5 8.Bc3 would leave an advantage to White.[76]For example, 8...Qe7 9.Bxe5 Qxe5 10.Nc3 d6 11.e3 and Black is at a loss for an equalising line,[78]White's advantage consisting in his ability to install his knight on the strong d5-square and to attack the weakened Black's kingside with the advance h2–h4. It is better for Black to continue with6...Nxf3+ 7.exf3when both 7...h5? and 7...Bg7 would fail to 8.Qe2+, so Black must try7...d6 8.Qe2+ Be6instead.[76]
After 8..Qa3 9 Rc1 creates good activity for White. If Black plays 9...Qxa2 White plans to play e4 with the idea of c5 and exchanging the queens on d5 would give White a big central advantage.
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Bf4 Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nc3
This is the only important line in the Budapest where Black is not ensured of regaining his sacrificed pawn. Black does best to immediately exchange the Nc3 with6...Bxc3+ 7.bxc3as otherwise White gets a small positional advantage simply by avoiding the doubled pawns (see the section "Advantages of ...Bb4+").[79][80]Then Black can put pressure on the e5-pawn with7...Qe7when White's only possibility to keep the pawn is8.Qd5. White threatens to ease the pressure with the move h2–h3 that would force the Ng4 to the unfavourable square h6, so Black's only possibilities to sustain the initiative are 8...Qa3 and 8...f6.
The line 8...Qa3 puts pressure on the white queenside pawns, pressure that may later be intensified with Nf6–e4. The black queen also gains access to the a5-square, from where it puts pressure on the e1–a5 diagonal aimed towards the white king. After 9.Rc1 f6 10.exf6 Nxf6 11.Qd2 d6 12.Nd4 0-0 we reach the position of the famous game between Rubinstein and Vidmar, when Rubinstein erred with 13.e3? and later lost.[81]After the better 13.f3 the correct method for Black is to target the c4-pawn with the regrouping Ne5/Qc5.[82]Hence Lalic thinks 11.Qd2 is inappropriate and gives Black excellent counterplay, and prefers 11.Qd3 or even 11.Qd1!? After 11.Qd3 0-0 12.g3 d6 13.Bg2 Black should switch to a materialistic mode with 13...Qxa2.[83]
In the other line8...f6Black does not want to decentralise his queen and prefers to concentrate on active piece play in the centre. After9.exf6 Nxf6, 10.Qd1, 10.Qd2 and 10.Qd3 are all possible, but each has its drawbacks: on d1 the queen is not developed, on d3 it is exposed to Bc8–f5 and on d2 it is exposed to Nf6–e4. Lalic considers 10.Qd3 to be the main move, qualifies 10.Qd1 as a "respectable option", but considers 10.Qd2 as "inaccurate". Meanwhile, Black will try to create counterplay by attacking either the weak c4-pawn, or the kingside with g7–g5 and h7–h5. In both cases a key possibility is the move Nf6–e4 that centralises the knight, attacks the weak c3-pawn, controls the c5-square and supports the g7–g5 thrust.
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Bf4 Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.a3
The Bb4 is attacked but Black can play7...Ngxe5to get the gambitted pawn back, as 8.axb4?? would allow the Kieninger trap 8...Nd3 mate (see the section "Kieninger trap"). Now White is more or less forced to exchange a pair of knights with8.Nxe5 Nxe5.[notes 4]White still cannot win a piece with 9.axb4?? Nd3# or 9.Bxe5?! Bxd2+ 10.Qxd2 Qxe5, so he usually plays9.e3in order to protect the c4-pawn and defuse the mating threat, so that now Black is obliged to move his Bb4. As 9...Bd6 would misplace the bishop and 9...Ba5?? would lose the bishop to 10.b4 Bb6 11.c5, Black usually plays9...Bxd2+ 10.Qxd2.[notes 5]
After 10.Qxd2, Tseitlin explains that "opening manuals assess this position as favourable to White on the basis of the bishop pair. However, considering the closed nature of the position, White faces substantial difficulties in the realisation of this nominal advantage."[84]Black has not a lot of things to be proud of as there are no targets in White's camp, but can put up a lot of resistance thanks to small assets. Black's Ne5 is strongly centralised, attacks the c4-pawn, and restricts the Bf1 from moving to the natural squares d3 and f3. Moreover, exchanging the knight with Bxe5 is not appealing for White, since that would mean losing the advantage of the bishop pair. Also, the Bc8 can sometimes become better than its counterpart the Bf1, if it makes it to the good squares b7 or c6 while the Bf1 remains restricted by the Ne5.
This explains the most natural plans for both sides. White will try aminority attackon the queenside, in order to increase its space advantage and to create some weaknesses in the black pawns (e.g. anisolated pawnor abackward pawn). So White will try to use the advances b2–b4 or c4–c5 in good conditions, supported by the queen and the rooks on the c-file and the d-file. On the other hand, Black will try to keep the position closed, most importantly by keeping the c4-pawn where it is in order to keep the Bf1 at bay. This can be achieved by moves like b7–b6 and d7–d6, and sometimes the manoeuvre Ne5–d7–f8–e6. The first move by Black has to be10...d6!because otherwise White plays 11.c5! and gets a clear advantage immediately. For example, 10...b6? loses a pawn to 11.Qd5 Nc6 12.Bxc7, and 10...0-0?! is bad because of 11.c5! Qxc5? 12.Rc1 Qe7 13.Rxc7 and White is winning already.[48]
International Master Timothy Taylor has suggested an alternative for Black on move 9. He regards 9...Bxd2+ as inferior, arguing that "the strong black bishop is traded for the inoffensive knight, and White gets the long-term advantage of the two bishops in a semi-open game".[85]Taylor instead advocates9...Bc5, when Black stands well after 10.b4 Bd4! (11.exd4?? Nd3#) 11.Rb1 d6 12.Be2 Bf5 13.Rb3 Ng6 14.Bg3 (14.exd4 Nxf4 15.Re3? Nxg2+ wins; 14.Bxd6 cxd6 15.exd4 Nf4 16.g3 Bc2! wins material) Bf6; 10.Ne4 Ng6; 10.Nb3 Bd6; or 10.Be2 d6.[86]
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Bf4 Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.a3 Ngxe5 8.Nxe5 Nxe5 9.e3 Bxd2+ 10.Qxd2 d6
After 10...d6! White can try (and has tried) about any move that supports the aforementioned plan. In particular, White has to choose if he wants to start active operations on the queenside immediately (e.g. Rc1, Qc3, c5), or if he wants to finish his development first (with Be2 and 0-0). The immediate 11.c5!? is a possible pawn sacrifice in order to open some diagonals for the bishops. As Lalic points out, "after 11...dxc5 Black's knight on e5 has lost its support and therefore all tactical motifs based on Qd5 and Bb5+ must be carefully checked".[87]White gets a powerful attack for his pawn but nothing decisive. The same idea can be tried with the preparatory 11.Rc1, and after 11...0-0 12.c5!? dxc5 13.Qd5 Ng6 14.Bg3 White should be reminded that he has not finished his development with 14...Qf6! and a counter-attack on the b2-pawn.[88][89]Playing Black,Svidlerchose a different path with 11...b6 but his opponentLesiègenevertheless sacrificed the pawn with 12.c5! bxc5 13.b4 0-0 14.bxc5 Bb7 15.f3 and Svilder chose to destroy his own pawn structure with 15...dxc5!? to activate his pieces and make use of the d-file.[90]The most popular move is 11.Be2, where White delays his queenside play until he has achieved castling.[91]It also gives Black more time to organise a defence on the queenside with b7–b6, either now or after 11...0-0.
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Bf4 Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.e3
In this variation White tries to avoid the move a2–a3 in order to gain a tempo over the 7.a3 variation. After the standard moves 7...Ngxe5 8.Nxe5 Nxe5 9.Be2 followed by 10.0-0 it is Black's last chance to exchange the Bb4 for the Nd2. The game will take an entirely different structure depending on whether Black gives up the bishop pair or tries to keep it.
Lalic thinks the strategies in which Black gives up the bishop pair (by exchanging its Bb4 for the Nd2) for nothing are a mistake. He does not like the strategy to retreat the Bb4 in d6 either, because they are too drawish. He recommends the strategy to retreat the bishop in c5, and maintain its position there with the help of the a7–a5 pawn advance.[92]
When Black opts for 10...Bxd2, he runs the risk to end up a tempo down over the 7.a3 variation and to be soon unable to meet White's positional threats on the queenside. White can avoid the push a2–a3 and continue with the standard plans of the 7.a3 variation.[93]However, everything is not that bad for Black. First, to implement his plan White has to concentrate on development (9.Be2, 10.0-0) before he turns his attention to the queenside. That means Black has more time to organise his play than in the 7.a3 variation, notably to attempt a blockade of the c5-square. Moreover, as White does not put immediate pressure on Black's position, Black is not compelled to castle rapidly and he can keep his king in the centre for a longer time, or even castle queenside. Hence Lalic note that "White has not wasted time with a2–a3, but in fact it is not so easy to capitalise on this extra tempo."[94]
A possibility for Black is to develop his light-square bishop rapidly, by prioritising the moves b7–b6 and Bc8–b7 over castling and d7–d6. The game Solozhenkin–Stiazhkin (Leningrad 1990) continued with 9...b6 10.0-0 Bxd2 11.Qxd2 Bb7 12.c5 bxc5 13.Qa5 d6 14.Bxe5 dxe5 15.Rfc1 and Moskalenko assesses this position as better for White;[95]Lalic suggests that 13...Ng6 is an improvement.[96]In the gameGausel–Reite (Norwegian Team Championship 1991), after the same 9.Be2 b6 10.0-0 Bxd2 11.Qxd2 Bb7 Black introduced a highly original plan by avoiding the natural advance d7–d6, and instead blocked a white c5-push by playing ...c5 himself. The game continued 12.Qc3 f6 13.b4 c5!? and Lalic was "deeply impressed by this plan, which really spoils all of White's fun". The c4-pawn is never allowed to advance, so that the Be2 is durably restricted. The Bf4 is obstructed by the Ne5, that cannot be easily removed. The weakness of the d7-pawn is not a worry as it can be protected by Bb7–c6 if necessary.[94]
After 9.Be2 0-0 10.0-0 Black can avoid the immediate exchange of his Bb4 against the Nd2 in several ways. The first one, resurrected and elaborated by the grandmasterPavel Blatny, is to exchange the Bb4 for the Bf4. This can be achieved via 10...Ng6 11.Bg3 (11.Bxc7?? d6 loses a piece) 11...Bd6 12.Bxd6 Qxd6. White still has possibilities to play for an advantage due to his more advanced development, his space advantage on the queenside and the possibility to install his knight on the good square d5. Taylor considers this Black's best line, stating that Black has not given White the bishop pair, nor weakened his pawn structure, and should be able to gradually equalize.[97]
The other possibility for Black is to keep his Bb4 as long as possible, exchanging it against the white knight only in favourable circumstances. A couple of attempts have been done with this in mind, with subtle variations along the moves a7–a5, b7–b6 and d7–d6. Against the mundane 10...d6 White can continue with 11.Nb3 (see diagram) to play on the queenside against the exposed Bb4, or 11.Nb1 to recycle the knight on the ideal d5-square. Another idea is the immediate 10...a5, to have the d6-square for the bishop, inhibit the b2–b4 push and have the possible a5–a4 pawn advance if the white knight moves to b3. In the game Mikhalevski–Chabanon (Bad Endbach 1995)[98]Black kept the bishop with 11.Nb3 a4 12.a3 Bd6 13.Nd4 Bc5 14.Nb5 d6 15.Nc3 Ng6 16.Bg3 f5 and had dynamic play.[99]
With 4...Bb4+ 5.Nbd2 d6 (see diagram) Black wants to open the diagonal a1–h8 for his queen. After 6.exd6 Qf6 White can react to the attack on his Bf4 in several ways, the best one being 7.Nh3 to develop a piece and protect both the Bf4 and the f2-pawn. It also helps that the Bf4 is still guarding the Nd2, so that after 7...Qxb2? there is not the threat of winning the exchange (8...Bxd2+ would be answered by 9.Bxd2) and White can repel Black's attack with 8.Rb1 Qa3 9.Rb3 Qa5 10.dxc7 Nc6 11.a3! Be7 12.e3.[100]Instead, Black must play energetically with 7...Nxf2 8.Kxf2 Bxh3 9.g3 Bxf1 10.dxc7!? Nc6 11.Rxf1 and here Lalic recommends 11...0-0 12.Kg2 Rfe8.[101]
The other gambit, 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nbd2 f6 7.exf6 Qxf6, is much riskier, as Black weakens his kingside and does not open a diagonal for his Bc8. Black tries to take advantage of the fact White has moved his dark-squared bishop away from the queenside, leaving the b2-pawn without protection. The correct plan for White was shown byGleizerovwho played 8.e3 Qxb2 9.Be2 d6 10.0-0 0-0 11.Nb3 Qf6 12.c5! to open the a2–g8 diagonal that was weakened precisely by the gambit move 6...f6. The move 11.Nb3 is not only useful to support the c4–c5 push, but also to exchange the knight against Black's dark-squared bishop after a possible a2–a3 forcing the retreat Bb4–c5.[102]As Lalic puts it, "I doubt if Black has a satisfactory answer to White's play in this game".[103]
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.e4
This variation is named afterAlekhinethanks to his wins in the games Alekhine–Rabinovic (Baden Baden, 1925) and Alekhine–Seitz (Hastings, 1926).[54][104][notes 6]White does not try to keep its material advantage (the e5-pawn) and concentrates on establishing a strong pawn centre and space advantage. A controversial point is whether the typical black manoeuvre Bf8–b4–xc3 is advantageous for Black (as it saddles White with doubled pawns) or for White (as it reinforces his centre). Lalic thinks both, considering 6...Bb4+ to be a bad move after 4...Nxe5 5.f4 Nec6 6.Nf3,[105]but a good one after 4...Nxe5 5.f4 Nec6 6.Be3.[106]After 4.e4 the main line is4...Nxe5 5.f4when Black has an important choice to make about where to move the Ne5. The retreat to the queenside with 5...Nec6 is considered best,[107]while the retreat to the kingside with 5...Ng6 is probably playable.[108]
Taylor considers 4...Nxe5 inferior, recommending instead a rarely played idea of Richard Réti,4...h5!(Taylor's exclamation point). Then 5.Nf3 would allow 5...Bc5, while Taylor suggests meeting 5.Be2 with 5...Nc6! and 5.f4 with 5...Bc5 with quick development compensating for the lost pawn. He considers the main line to be 4...h5 5.h3 Nxe5 6.Be3 Bb4+, with good play for Black.[109]
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.e4 Nxe5 5.f4 Nec6
The knight on c6 is safer than on g6, and is well-placed as part of a general strategy to control the central dark squares. It can go to d4 while the other knight can go to c5 via a6 or d7. After 6.Nf3 Bc5 White has difficulties castling short, because the plan to exchange the dark-squared bishops with Bd3/Qe2/Be3 can be met by Bg4/Nd4 to muddy the waters.[110]As Lalic points out:[111]
White can no longer castle kingside and will usually have to go the other way. However, this is rather slow and gives Black time to try to undermine the white centre. To this end Bc8–g4 often comes in handy, in order to pin the white knight on f3 against the white queen. Note that Black should wait until his opponent has wasted a tempo with Qe2.
The main continuation6.Be3controls the a7–g1 diagonal and is considered to be the best reply.[112]If Black wants to contest the c5-square for his Bf8 he can try 6...Na6,[113]but most games continue with6...Bb4+. Here the best reply for White is controversial.[notes 7]
After 7.Nc3 Black has thezwischenzug7...Qh4+ 8.g3 Bxc3+ 9.bxc3 Qe7 so that the diagonal a8–h1 is weakened before Black develops the Bc8 to the b7-square. The queen on the e7-square is well placed to pressure the e4-pawn. However, as most of Black's pieces are on the queenside, continuing with pawn pushes like f7–f5 is probably too weakening, as Alekhine demonstrated in his game against Seitz in 1925.[114]So Black does best to attack with pieces, possibly with the setup b6/Nc5/Bb7/0-0-0.[115]In that case Tseitlin considers that with a knight on c5 the move d7–d6 should be avoided if Black has to respond to the capture Bxc5 by dxc5, because the white pawns in e4 and f4 would have too much leeway.[116]
After 7.Nd2 Qe7 8.a3 Lalic considers 8...Qxe4 should be avoided, e.g. the continuation 9.Kf2 Bxd2 10.Qxd2 0-0 11.Nf3 d6 12.Re1 gives White several tempi against the black queen.[117]After the better 8...Bc5 9.Bxc5 Qxc5 10.Qf3 Lalic recommends 10...a5.[118]The introduction of the intermediate 7...Qh4+ 8.g3 Qe7 does not change Lalic's opinion, as after 9.Bg2 Na6 10.a3 Bc5 11.Bxc5 Nxc5 12.b4 Ne6 the bishop was well placed on g2 and Black experienced difficulties developing the Bc8.[119]But Lalic does not mention the gamePomar–Heidenfeldcited by Borik, in which Black played the advance a7–a5 to restrict the white advance b2–b4, and achieved equality after 9.Bg2 a5 10.Ne2 Na6.[120]Instead, he recommends 7...d6 8.Nf3 0-0 9.Bd3 and now the same development as in Pomar's game:[121]
9...a5 and 10...Na6 deserves attention, when White's movements on the queenside are more restricted and the black knight will be able to settle on the c5-square without being kicked by the thematic b2–b4. It may appear that we have reached the same position elaborated in previous games a tempo down for Black, since he has committed his bishop to b4 and will later drop back to the c5-square instead of heading there at once. However, the white knight is less actively placed on d2 and in fact this fully compensates Black for the slight loss of time.
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.e4 Nxe5 5.f4 Ng6
The knight on g6 puts the f4-pawn under pressure, but may be embarrassed later by the pawn thrust f4–f5. Now 6.a3, an attempt to deny squares from the Bf8 by continuing with b2–b4 or Bc1–e3, does not achieve its goal after 6...Bc5! 7.b4?! Bxg1! 8.Rxg1 0-0! 9.Qf3 d6 10.g4 a5 11.b5 Nd7 12.Ra2 Nc5 when Black's superior pawn structure and well-positioned Nc5 gives him the advantage.[122]That leaves White with the choice between 6.Nf3 and 6.Be3.
The move 6.Nf3 controls the e5-square in order to prepare the push f4–f5. Unlike after 5...Nec6, White does not have to fear 6...Bc5?!, which encounters difficulties after 7.f5! Nh4 8.Ng5!, when the black knight is already in danger of being lost to Qd1–g4 or Qd1–h5.[123]Instead Black must react quickly with 6...Bb4+ 7.Nc3 when he can adopt a normal setup with d6/0-0/Nc6/b6 or act boldly with 7...Qf6 threatening both the Nc3 and the f4-pawn.[124]One point in favour of 7...Qf6 is that after 8.e5 Qb6 the black queen prevents White from castling short and is well placed if White castles long.[125]
The move 6.Be3 takes the a7–g1 diagonal from Black's Bf8 and may in some lines prepare the long castle. After the mandatory 6...Bb4+ White can opt for 7.Nd2 to avoid having doubled pawns, but he must be prepared to sacrifice a pawn after 7...Qe7 8.Kf2!? Bxd2 9.Qxd2 Qxe4 10.Bd3 with piece activity for the pawn deficit,[126]because the normal defence 8.Bd3? runs into 8...Qd6! and both the Bd3 and the f4-pawn are attacked.[127]White does not need, however, bother too much about the doubled pawns and after 7.Nc3 Bxc3+ 8.bxc3 a peaceful black player might choose the quiet 8...b6!? followed by a normal development with d6/0-0/Bb7/Nd7/Re8/Nc5.[108]Instead of 8...b6 a more adventurous black player could choose 8...Qe7 9.Bd3 f5!? as indicated by Borik, Tseitlin and Lalic,[108][128][129]but in his more recent book Moskalenko thinks "this move complicates the game too much".[130]If the black player is neither peaceful nor aggressive, Lalic proposes an alternative with 8...Qe7 9.Bd3 0-0 10.Qd2 and only now that Black has his king safe shall he unleash 10...f5!?, when "it is not so easy for White to meet [10...f5] as the two main responses, 11.e5 and 11.exf5, allow Black promising chances with 11...d6 and 11...Nxf4 respectively".
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ne4
The Fajarowicz variation is said to have its origins in the chess circles fromLeipzig, with the first important game being H.Steiner–Fajarowiczat the 1928Wiesbadentournament.[131][132]In this variation, Black makes no immediate effort to regain the gambit pawn, preferring to concentrate on active piece play and tactical tricks.[notes 8]
The move4.a3allows White to avoid the annoying bishop check on b4, the also annoying knight jump to b4, and prepares Qc2 to undermine Black's knight. Both Lalic andde Firmianconsider it to be White's best move,[133]with de Firmian assessing it as leading to a large advantage for White.[134]Lalic considers 4...b6!? to be the best answer, one point being that Qd1–c2, so effective in most of the other lines, can be met by Bc8–b7. After 5.Nd2 Bb7 6.Qc2 Lalic gives 6...Nxd2 7.Bxd2 a5! when the black bishops will be excellently placed on the b7- and c5-squares.[135]White cannot win a piece with 5.Qd5?!because of the usual trick 5...Nc5!6.Qxa8?Bb7 7.Qxa7 Nc6, trapping White's queen. Lalic recommends 6.Nf3 instead,[136]while de Firmian continues by 5.Nf3 Bb7 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.Qc2 with a large advantage for White.[134][137]
The move4.Nf3develops a piece and covers the sensitive d2-square. After 4...Bb4+ 5.Nbd2 Nc6 6.a3 Black can easily get confused by the move-order. The natural 6...Nxd2 7.Bxd2 Bxd2+ 8.Qxd2 Qe7 9.Qc3 transposes in the same position as after 5.Bd2, but White can also try 6...Nxd2 7.axb4! Nxf3+ 8.gxf3 Nxe5 9.Rg1 Qe7 10.Ra3! with a strong initiative.[138]White can even retain his bishop with 6...Nxd2 7.Nxd2 and now Borik recommends 7...Bf8 with difficult play for Black as he is not certain to gain his pawn back.[139]To avoid these possibilities Lalic advises the move-order 6...Bxd2+ 7.Bxd2 Nxd2 8.Qxd2 Qe7, but does not mention the possibility of White answering 6...Bxd2+ with 7.Nxd2. A possible improvement for Black (after 4...Bb4+ 5.Nbd2) would be 5...d5 with compensation for the pawn in all lines.[140]
The line4.Qc2immediately attacks the Ne4, as a retreat by Black would effectively surrender his temporary lead in development, which is the compensation for the sacrificed pawn. Black must continue to develop while trying to keep the Ne4 on its square, but that is by no means easy. Borik thinks 4.Qc2 is the move "that gives Black the most problems to solve",[141]but Lalic does not agree at all, stating that the reply "4...Bb4+ [....] followed by d7–d5 ensures Black a rapid development and plenty of counterplay. It is for this reason that 4.Qc2 is not on the danger list".[142]The reply 4...Bb4+ (see diagram) pins the white pieces before deciding what to do with the Ne4. White cannot reply 5.Bd2 as he would lose the bishop pair and Black would easily regain the e5-pawn with Nc6/Qe7/0-0/Re8. After 5.Nd2 this knight would be misplaced and would block the Bc1, so Black could open the game with 5...d5 in favourable circumstances. Best for White is 5.Nc3 d5 6.exd6 Bf5 7.Bd2 Nxd6 8.e4! Bxc3 9.Bxc3 Bxe4 when Black has regained his pawn but White has the bishop pair and possibilities of an attack on the kingside.[143]
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.e3
Apart from the main lines 4.Bf4, 4.Nf3 and 4.e4, the only significant other fourth move is4.e3to continue by 4...Nxe5 5.Nh3 (or the other move-order 4.Nh3 and 5.e3) so that the white knight starts the journey Ng1–h3–f4–d5 reach its ideal d5-square.[144]The idea with 4.e3 and 5.Nh3 was favourite of a leading Soviet coach and writerMikhail Shereshevsky, who wrote in his 1994 bookThe Soviet Chess Conveyorthat the line was first shown to him by a strongcorrespondenceplayerDonatas Lapienis.[145]Black has tried to prevent White's idea by the suitably strange-looking move 5...Ng6, taking the f4-square from the Nh3. Then White can develop along various setups, the most active being 6.Qh5 with the possibility Nh3–g5 in store to recycle the knight towards a more central position.[146]Black can also ignore White's intentions and concentrate on his own play by placing the Nb8 on c5, in order to put pressure on the d3-square. After 5...g6 6.Nf4 Bg7 7.Be2 0-0 8.0-0 d6 9.Nc3 Nbd7 10.Qd2 a5 11.b3 Nc5 the position of Black's knights is secured and Black's position is similar to the Leningrad variation of theDutch Defence(once he has played f7–f5).[147]White has no reason, however, to abandon the a1–h8 diagonal to Black, and he can try 5...g6 6.Bd2 d6 7.Nf4 Bg7 8.Bc3 0-0 9.Be2 Nbd7 10.Nd2 b6 and in one game White gained a minimal edge.[148]
A few other lines have been tried, with the outcome varying from an immediate equality to a clear advantage for Black. The cooling4.e6avoids complications and heads for an equal endgame with 4...dxe6 5.Qxd8+ Kxd8, Black's loss of the right to castle being of no great importance since queens have been traded. If Black wants to avoid this early endgame, he can try 4...Bb4+ 5.Nc3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 dxe6 and now the exchange of queens would give a plus to Black, as the white queenside pawns are isolated and doubled.[149]The greedy4.f4is weak because White neglects his development and weakens the a7–g1 diagonal.[150][151][152][153]Black can immediately exploit this with 4...Bc5, which threatens a fork on f2 and forbids White's castling; Black may later push d7–d6 to open the centre, e.g. 5.Nh3 0-0 6.Nc3 d6 7.exd6 cxd6 when Black has good squares for its pieces while White's castling is delayed.
Another reasonable-looking move is4.Qd4as it protects the e5-pawn and attacks the Ng4. However,"the problem for White in the Budapest is that natural moves often lead to disaster".[154]Best for Black is the gambit 4...d6 5.exd6 Nc6! 6.Qd1 Bxd6, when the natural 7.Nf3?? is an error because of 7...Nxf2! 8.Kxf2 Bg3+ winning the queen.[155]White must develop quietly with moves like Nc3/Nf3/e3/Be2, allowing Black to find active positions for his pieces with 0-0/Be6/Qe7/Rfd8, and preparing several sacrificial ideas on e3 or f2, with excellent attacking possibilities.[156]Similar to 4.Qd4 is4.Qd5when after 4...Nc6 White can seize the last opportunity to return to calm waters with 5.Bf4 Bb4+ 6.Nc3 which will transpose in the Rubinstein line,[157]or he can try 5.Nf3 d6 6.exd6 Be6 7.d7+ Bxd7 when Black's lead in development compensates for the pawn.[158]
Declining the gambit is almost never seen in master play because it promises White equality at best. After3.d5?!Bc5 White has prematurely blocked the central position, giving the a7–g1 diagonal to Black for his bishop. In this variation Black can either play on the queenside with a plan like b5/Nb6/Bd7, or on the kingside with a plan like Ne8/g6/Ng7/f5.[159]The shy3.e3?!exd4 4.exd4 transposes into a line of the Exchange Variation of theFrench Defencewith 4...d5, but Black can also develop rapidly with 4...Bb4+ 5.Bd2 Bxd2+ 6.Nxd2 0-0.[160][161]After3.e4?Black gains a crushing attack via 3...Nxe4 4.dxe5 Bc5 5.Nh3 d6 6.Qe2 f5 7.exf6 0-0! 8.fxg7 Re8 9.Be3 Bxe3 10.fxe3 Bxh3 11.gxh3 Qh4+.[162][163]After3.Bg5?!the game Ladmann–Tartakower(Scarborough 1929) continued with 3...exd4 4.Qxd4 Be7 5.Nf3 Nc6 6.Qd1 Ne4 7.Bxe7 Qxe7 8.a3 d6 9.e3 0-0 10.Be2 Qf6 11.Nbd2 Bf5 when both Tseitlin and Borik assess the position as favourable for Black.[160][164]After3.Nf3?!the game Menchik–Tartakower (Paris 1929)[165]continued with 3...e4 4.Nfd2 d5 5.cxd5?! Qxd5 6.e3 Bb4 7.Nc3 Bxc3 8.bxc3 0-0 and White has problems developing his kingside because of the potential weakness of g2.[164]
The following game was played between the Chinese GMWu Shaobin(White) and Armenian IMAshot Nadanian(Black) at Singapore 2006.[notes 9]
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Nf3 Bc5 5.e3 Nc6 6.Be2 Ncxe5 7.Nxe5 Nxe5 8.0-0 0-0 9.b3 Re8 10.Bb2 a5Preparing Dolfi Drimer's rook manoeuvre Ra8–a6–h6. Nadanian calls the pawn advance a7–a5 "the soul of the Budapest Gambit".[166]11.Nc3 Ra6 12.Ne4 Ba7 13.Ng3 Qh4 14.Nf5 Qg5!?This was a new move, before 14...Qe4 had been played.15.Nd4 Rg6 16.g3 d5?!18...Qh6 was stronger.17.cxd5?White should have played 17.Nb5!17...Bh3! 18.Re1 Ng4 19.Nf3 Qxe3!Karolyi writes, "This shows Kasparov-like aggression and ingenuity."20.Bd4 Qxf2+!!21.Bxf2 Bxf2+ 22.Kh1 Bb6 23.Qb1?White should have defended with 23.Rf1! After 23...Ne3 24.Qd3 Bg2+ 25.Kg1 Bh3 White can either repeat moves with 26.Kh1, or try 26.Nd4.23...Nf2+ 24.Kg1 Rf6!Black has time to increase the pressure.25.b4!If 25.Qc2?, then 25...Ng4+ 26.Kh1 Bg2+! winning the queen.25...a4!But not 25...Rxf3? 26.bxa5.26.Ng5Black can now force mate in 8 moves.26...Ng4+! 27.Kh1 Bg2+!!"This is a marvellous move, and it must have been such a thrill to play it on the board." (Karolyi).28.Kxg2 Rf2+ 29.Kh3 Rxh2+ 30.Kxg4 h5+ 31.Kf4 Be3+0–1[167]
This is considered with good reason to be White's best system against the Budapest Gambit. White hands the pawn back, but in return gains control of d5. Over the next few moves, however, he has to play with extreme precision, since otherwise his central pawn position may become the object of a successful attack by Black.

## Calabrese Countergambit

# Content [from](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/calabrese-countergambit/)

The Italian Game is white’s effort to quickly develop his light square bishop and dominate the center of the board. The Calabrese Countergambit is black’s way of giving up his f-pawn to completely thwart all of white’s game plan. The more aggressive white tries to be in the opening the more potential traps he can fall into.
1. e4 e52. Bc4 f5
Black usually ends up with a very strong center while white’s pieces struggle to find great squares to develop. White must play very precise or he can easily find himself in a lot of trouble.
If you like to attack as the black pieces then the Calabrese Countergambit is definitely something you should try out.

## Caro-Kann
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Caro-Kann-Defense)
The Caro-Kann Defense is known above all for its solidity. The defining move, 1...c6, is the fourth most popular reply to 1.e4 and nearly twice as common as the number five move. It prepares for 2...d5 without blocking in the light-squared bishop, which is considered the main drawback of its cousin the French Defense (1.e4 e6). A standby for positional players at almost every level, the Caro-Kann was a particular favorite of world champion GMAnatoly Karpov.
TheCaro-Kannbegins with1.e4 c6, with most variations continuing2.d4 d5. Either one of these is usually considered the starting position for the Caro-Kann.
The Caro-Kann is a somewhat complicated opening with several respected variations. On White's second move, 2.d4 is by far the most common. The main exception to know is the Two Knights Defense (1.e4 c6 2.Nf3 d5 3.Nc3).
White's third move is where the Caro really branches out. White has no fewer than five popular choices here.
3.Nc3 is White's most common choice by a narrow margin over 3.e5. Black almost always captures with 3...dxe4, with White making the obvious reply 4.Nxe4. White can also reach these lines with 3.Nd2 when 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4 transposes.
From here, the game can go in several respected directions but 4...Bf5 is Black's most popular, and this is the Classical Variation. Black very reasonably develops the light-squared bishop, which is why the move ...e6 has been avoided to this point in the first place. White can, and often does, chase the bishop, but this weakens the kingside.
The Karpov Variation is 4...Nd7. It is named after—no surprise here—Anatoly Karpov. Black prepares to develop the other knight to f6, but without having to recapture with a pawn.
That said, this move isn't absolutely necessary, and White is under no obligation to take on f6. In fact, after 5.Nf3 Nf6, White plays 6.Ng3 almost as often as 6.Nxf6 and scores far better with it, in part because the bishop remains boxed in on c8, just by the knight on d7 instead of a pawn on e6.
Almost as common as 4...Nd7 is the immediate 4...Nf6, even though it results in doubled pawns.
White can play 5.Ng3 but 5.Nxf6 is the most popular and most challenging move. Black can capture towards the center with 5...gxf6, known as the Bronstein-Larsen Variation (after GMsDavid BronsteinandBent Larsen), or away from the center with 5...exf6, the Tartakower Variation (after GMSavielly Tartakower). The former is a more dynamic choice in exchange for a shattered pawn structure. The latter, while obviously also resulting in doubled pawns, is still more solid and less compromised. Both moves are about equally popular.
White does not have to play Nc3 on move three. The aptly named Advance Variation, 3.e5, is White's sharpest and best-scoring continuation. GMVladimir Kramnikused it to retain his classical world champion title against GMPeter Lekoin the 14th and final game of their 2004 match.
The three most popular continuations after 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 Bf5 all score well despite taking different approaches to the position: 4.Nc3 is the Shirov Variation with the main idea of playing g4 and advancing on the kingside; 4.h4 is the Tal Variation and takes a different path to kingside expansion; and 4.Nf3 is the Short Variation, aiming for a more positional struggle.
When White captures on d5, it is known as the Exchange Variation. After the obvious 3...cxd5--if planning on recapturing with the queen, Black should have just played the Scandinavian (1...d5)--White can either play 4.Bd3 or the much sharper 4.c4 (as seen below).
When White plays 4.Bd3 the goal is a quiet game. It is much rarer at higher levels than the other main move because Black gets a good game.
The latter of these moves is known as the Panov-Botvinnik Attack, with similar positions to the Queen's Gambit. White usually gets anisolated queen's pawn.
The Fantasy Variation, 3.f3, comes in a clear fifth but the move scores well. White prepares to recapture on e4 with the f-pawn, thus maintaining two pawns in the center instead of just one, a much different pawn structure than Caro players are usually going for.
The Advance Variation scores 43% for White against 30% for Black. The Fantasy Variation, at 44% to 33%, fares almost as well, but much of its value is as a surprise weapon. The Advance Variation, meanwhile, is a move that Black must be prepared for, and it still scores well. It is also very sharp with relatively few draws compared to most Caro-Kann lines.
Also a surprisingly effective way for White to meet the Caro-Kann is with 2.c4 instead of 2.d4. It may be an even better surprise weapon than the Fantasy Variation, as White still wins 44% of the time but only loses 23%. A lot of times 2.c4 will transpose into the Panov-Botvinnik Attack.
The Caro-Kann is named for Horatio Caro and Marcus Kann, two 19th century players who analyzed it. Its first appearance in a published game camebetween two unknown players in 1845, while the analysis by Caro and Kann came in the 1880s.
Like many openings, the Caro-Kann did not gain much respect until the 20th century. At the 1927 New York tournament, world championJose Raul Capablancaused it as his main weapon against 1.e4 and scored two wins with three draws and no losses.
In his 1958 rematch with GMVassily Smyslov, GMMikhail Botvinnikbecame the first player to use the Caro-Kann in a match for the world championship, and he would do so again in both his championship matches against GMMikhail Talfrom 1960-61. GMTigran Petrosianalso used it to defend his title against GMBoris Spasskyin 1966.
By then, the Caro-Kann was well established as one of Black's most viable options against 1.e4. GMMagnus Carlsenused it against GMViswanathan Anandin the 2013 World Championship. The Caro-Kann is currently a favorite of GMAlireza Firouzja.
Of the five times Capablanca played the Caro-Kann at New York 1927, none is more famous than his dismantling of Aron Nimzowitsch's Advance Variation.
Bronstein showed how dangerous his 5...gxf6 variation could be in this win against Nikolay Bakulin in 1965.
The fourth move 4...Nd7 shone in 1973 when Petrosian crushed Tal with it.
The Caro-Kann is a great option for positional players. While some lines can get tactical, the opening is fundamentally solid. Learn more about it with theChess.com Lessonfrom GMSam Shanklandor by exploring ourMaster Gamesdatabase.

## Catalan Opening
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Catalan-Opening)
The Catalan Opening is a 1.d4 opening where White seeks to combine the kingside fianchetto with pawns on d4/c4. Instead of a direct kingside attack, White will aim for long-term positional pressure in the center and on Black's queenside. These positions can lead to small and nagging edges with very technical endgames.
The Catalan usually begins1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3but other move orders are possible, for example 1.d4 d5 2.c4e6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.g3. The main idea is White fianchettoing on the kingside after playing the standard queen pawn opening moves d4 and c4, while Black plays ...e6. If Black instead also fianchettoes the kingside bishop, it's aKing's Indian Defense.
There are three main ways for Black to meet the Catalan: playing ...dxc4 (Open Catalan), reinforcing the d5-pawn with ...c6 (Closed Catalan), or avoiding it altogether by delaying or avoiding ...d5, usually with an early ...c5 instead.
Black opens the diagonal for White's g2-bishop. In some cases, White can regain the pawn by playing Qa4+ and Qxc4 before Black castles, but sometimes not. White must be prepared to treat the opening as a positional gambit (like theBenkofor Black), trying to put pressure down the h1-a8 diagonal, as in this uncommon line that nonetheless appeared in the 2021 World Championship:
If the pawn is not kept, Black must find a way to fight on the diagonal, as in this line:
When Black does not play ...dxc4, and instead secures the d-pawn with ...c6, it is the Closed Catalan. The traditional line, which is still the most common, goes:
Black simply blunts the a8-h1 diagonal that White has hoped to gain an advantage by controlling. Like most games with a closed center, the opening often turns into a slow, maneuvering middlegame.
Using the 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3 move order as the baseline, the nomenclature of what is considered the Catalan is such that Black can avoid the opening with any number of moves early on. For example, 3...c5 will usually transpose into either theBenonior a variation of theEnglish Opening.Black's other alternative, 3...Bb4+, comes closer to aBogo-Indianthan a Catalan, especially given the typical development of White's g1-knight to f3 in either opening.Black is also under no obligation to play 2...e6, avoiding the Catalan before it even gets started; most notably, 2...g6 3.g3 would produce a variation of the King's Indian.
As advantageous as the Catalan can be for White, White must be prepared to face all of these alternatives. Otherwise, the game can steer into a direction more favorable for Black.
According toModern Chess Openings, the Catalan Opening gets its name from the 1929 Barcelona tournament where GMSavielly Tartakoweris supposed to have invented it. However, there are instances of it appearing as far back as 1909. The opening first appeared in a World Championship in 1937 and was played extensively in the 2006 and 2010 World Championships. After a decade-long hiatus, it reappeared in the2021 FIDE World Championship.

# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_Opening)
TheCatalan Openingis achess openingwhere White plays d4 and c4 andfianchettoesthe white bishop on g2. A common opening sequence is 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3, although various other openings cantransposeinto the Catalan. TheEncyclopaedia of Chess Openings(ECO) lists codes E01–E09 for lines with 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3 d5 4.Bg2; other lines are part of E00.
In the Catalan, White adopts a combination of theQueen's GambitandRéti Opening. White combines the space-gaining moves d4 and c4 with g3, preparing to fianchetto the king's bishop. This places pressure mainly on the queenside while hoping to keep the white king safe in the long-term. The c4-pawn can become vulnerable, however, and White might have tosacrificea pawn.
Black has two main approaches to play against the Catalan: in the Open Catalan Black plays ...dxc4 and can either try to hold on to the pawn with ...b5 or give it back for extra time to free their game. In the Closed Catalan, Black does not capture on c4; their game can be somewhatcrampedfor a while, but is quitesolid. Additionally, Black has ways to avoid the Catalan.
The Catalan has had proponents at the highest level in chess, withVladimir Kramnik,Viswanathan AnandandMagnus Carlsenall employing the opening in their World Chess Championship title games. A number of other grandmasters have successfully played the Catalan, includingFabiano Caruana,Daniil Dubov,Anish GiriandDing Liren.
The Catalan derives its name fromCatalonia, after tournament organisers at the 1929Barcelonatournament askedSavielly Tartakowerto create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history. It had been played a few times before Tartakower's usage in the tournament, however: for instance,Réti–Leonhardt, Berlin 1928 transposed into an Open Catalan. The opening cemented itself in the repertoire of leading players of the 1930s and 1940s, such as world championsJose Raul Capablanca,Alexander AlekhineandMikhail Botvinnik, as well as top grandmasters such asSalo Flohr,Paul KeresandSamuel Reshevsky.[1]
The Catalan came to prominence at the top level when bothGarry KasparovandViktor Korchnoiplayed it in their Candidates Semifinal match in London in 1983: five games of the eleven-game match featured the Catalan.
In 2004,Ruben Felgaerwon a tournament celebrating the 75th anniversary of Barcelona 1929 and the birth of the Catalan Opening, ahead ofGrandmasters(GMs) Viktor Korchnoi,Mihail Marin, Lluis Comas and Viktor Moskalenko andInternational MasterManel Granados. Each game in the tournament, which was also held in Barcelona, began with the moves 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.g3 Nf6.
With its use byVladimir Kramnik, the Catalan gained a good deal of attention by high-level GMs in the 2010s.  Kramnik played the opening three times in theWorld Chess Championship 2006. The Catalan was also played four times byViswanathan Anandin theWorld Chess Championship 2010; in both instances, the opponent wasVeselin Topalov, and in each instance, White scored two more points than Black.
Magnus Carlsenbegan to employ the Catalan as his main opening in the late 2010s, most notably using it in the second game of the2021 World Chess ChampionshipagainstIan Nepomniachtchi, and used it extensively at theTata Steel Chess Tournament 2022.
The Open Catalan, Classical Line (ECOcode E05) consists of the moves 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3 d5 4.Bg2 dxc4 5.Nf3 Be7. White sacrifices the pawn for a lead indevelopment. Without a black pawn on d5, White'skingsidebishop hinders Black'squeensidedevelopment. The Open Catalan line has been a favorite ofAnatoly KarpovandEfim Gelleras Black and ofOleg Romanishinas White. Usually, White will recover the pawn with Qc2 and then a4, Ne5, or Qa4+. In order to hold the pawn, Black will have to seriously weaken the queenside with ...a6 and ...b5.

# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chigorin_Defense)
TheChigorin Defenseis achess openingnamed for 19th-centuryRussianmasterMikhail Chigorin. An uncommonly played defense to theQueen's Gambit, it begins with the following moves:
The Chigorin Defense violates several classical principles: Black does not maintain the center pawn at d5, the c-pawn is blocked, and Black must be willing to trade abishopfor aknight. In return, Black gets quickdevelopmentand piece pressure on thecenter.
Although opening assessments change as improvements are found for each side, the Chigorin is generally consideredplayablefor Black, and it is useful as a surprise weapon against the Queen's Gambit.Alexander Morozevichis perhaps the only modern grandmaster who regularly plays the Chigorin Defense; in the 1980s,Vasily Smyslovdid employ the opening againstGarry Kasparov, achieving a draw.[1]Morozevich has also published a book on the Chigorin Defense,[2]in which he gives both a theoretical and a personal view on the opening.
The Chigorin Defense has the classification D07 in theEncyclopedia of Chess Openings.
Because the Chigorin is an unusual defense, thetheory of this openingis not as well developed as that for more popular openings. After 1.d4 d5 2.c4 Nc6, some of the most commonly played variations are:

## Cochrane Gambit
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/article/view/the-cochrane-gambit)
by GM Magesh and GM Arun
Are you the kind of player who wants to attack, attack, and attack more? Are you the kind of player who wants something happening in your game every single moment? Are you the kind of player who would take an unclear position any day over an equal position? Okay! Firstly I think I sound like a voice from an advertisement trying to sell Advil or something and secondly, I think you get my point already. Today's article is for all those people who care more about playing an entertaining game than a perfect game; for those who are driven to playing chess to stimulate their imagination; for all those who enjoy chess as an art as much as a sport.
John Cochrane was a nineteenth century Scottish chess master. And he was a strong one too, ranked only below Howard Staunton who is very well known for his design of the chess pieces that we still use in tournament play. Cochrane was a well known name in the Calcutta (now known as Kolkatta) chess club as he played against several Indian players there while he lived in India. The first appearance of the Cochrane gambit against the Petrov's defense according to Wikipedia and my Mega Database was in the year 1848 against an Indian master Mohishunder Bannerjee.
An idea to sacrifice your knight on move three would pretty much be ridiculed in modern computer-assisted opening preparation. However, it does promise a a game full of action and adventure. Let us start from where it all began,



Interestingly in the last four moves of the game there were three huge blunders that would have drastically changed the end result of the game. An inspiring idea in the opening, but an imperfect game. I guess we did not promise anything different in this article.
Our next game is from a very familiar name around here on chess.com, IM David Pruess. David is exactly the kind of player who puts a lot of emphasis on getting an exciting game and he proves that by choosing the Cochrane gambit in the following game.

A very nice finish, but if you have an uncastled king and undeveloped bishop and rooks sitting idle by move twenty, then you are just inviting trouble. It's only what's on the table that counts. All your undeveloped extra material can only make you feel worse when your king is left abandoned.
An interesting idea overall which can definitely be refuted with a few hours of preparation using our little friend "Rybka," obviously! Nevertheless, most positions arising out of this opening can cause quite a few practical problems for the players facing it.

do everyone a favor and just stop with this non-sense.
wht are yu mad do not dare to post anything on my forum again its not for losers like you
The Colorado-Gambit is a really fascinating opening, too bad that there is at least one line, where only White has all the fun.
I wonder, why you are showing several lines, but not the critical one.
in the lines with Bb5 white is better in all variations.
1.secez center

lololol
wht are yu mad do not dare to post anything on my forum again its not for losers like you

No offense, but all you seem to comment about is how achintya is a bad player, and nothing else.  Try to focus on something else, please.

As for the Colorado Gambit, I personally think it's unsound, and the line that Dark_Falcon gave above is the way that White should probably go if he wants to gain an advantage.  It's a bit of a tricky variation to deal with if White is unprepared, but it's been getting a bit more attention recently (especially on this site), so I'm pretty sure relying on the pure surprise value won't cut it at all anymore.  Of course, no player who uses the Nimzowitsch wants to respond to 2.Nf3 with 2...e5, so it's perfectly reasonable to find a response that stays independent while also remaining playable.  However, I really don't see the Colorado Gambit as the answer, because it gives White a good amount of play without much compensation for Black.  There are definitely other lines that are equally creative and yet more sound (my personal favorite was 2...Nf6), but 2.Nf3 is definitely a problem for Black that is yet to be solved.
It's not that he's a bad player, it is just that he makes it look like "his" analysis is groundbreaking, while it is clearly missing critical lines, as shown by alot of players already. As for 2.Nf3, I like to transpose to some sort of weird pirc defense with a knight on c6.

go on above links to know more
about missing lines i am soon going to put them through games

Why do post several games with crap declined lines like 3.e5?! or even better 3.Nh4???
Its a Gambit, so you can only proof its soundness when you accept it.
And please comment the refutation line 3.exf5 d5 4.Bb5...
If you present an opening in a thread you have to reply on critical comments.
i will post refusation to some critical lines
Errr, he forgot to deal with 3.Ke2!
Can Black equalize after this?
No way, Mr. pfren. I think you found Colo's Achilles!
There are many poor, but difficult to face openings for weaker players.  IMO this isn't one of them.
yes, it can see the all links i have posted and you will get your answer
Errr, he forgot to deal with 3.Ke2!
Can Black equalize after this?
I always thought, you would prefer solid chess :D
But 3.Ke2 is clearly an error...cause its refuted by 3...Kf7!

The Colorado Gambit is an aggressive line in the Nimzowitsch Defence. Black looks to weaken his king side pawn structure in exchange for some deadly attacks against white. This is a solid opening for black but usually works best as a surprise opening against a player that hasn’t studied all of the lines.
1. e4 Nc62. Nf3 f5
White must play carefully as there are many traps and dangerous lines that black can play. Unlike other gambits, black would prefer that white not take the pawn on f5. Instead, black would like to control the center of the board with the f5 pawn and quickly development the rest of his pieces.
Many of the variations in this opening have safe lines and aggressive lines. If you choose to play the Colorado Gambit I recommend you go with the more aggressive lines. Because e4 is so common, you’ll have many opportunities to try out this opening.
Make sure you check out the video below to learn more about all the variations.

## Danish Gambit
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Danish-Gambit)
The Danish Gambit is an aggressive 1.e4 e5 opening for White. This opening is well-suited for aggressive players who don't mind sacrificing pawns for the initiative. Although it is rare in master-level play, the Danish Gambit can be a fun and playable opening for club-level players.
The Danish Gambit starts with the moves1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.c3. White attacks Black's only central pawn and offers a pawn sacrifice for quick development.
White's third move aims to develop their pieces quickly, while Black moves their pawn repeatedly. If Black is careless, White can also recapture the black d4-pawn and build a strong center.
There are three main variations of the Danish Gambit. Black either accepts or declines the pawn sacrifice. If Black accepts the gambit, White can choose one of two main variations.
The most popular variation in case Black accepts the gambit is1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Bc4. White offers yet another pawn to develop even quicker, putting pressure on Black's f7-pawn.
If Black takes the b2-pawn, White develops their other bishop with 4.Bxb2, putting even more pressure on Black's kingside.
White can also play the Danish Gambit Accepted by recapturing the pawn on c3 with1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3. This move recaptures the pawn and develops the queenside knight to a natural square, from where it attacks the center.
Although slightly more conservative than the line with 3.Bc4, this line is also dangerous for Black if they don't know what to do. White is a pawn down but has a lead in development. White also enjoys open lines for all their minor pieces, while Black is severely underdeveloped.
Black can also refuse the pawn sacrifice and play a safer game with the moves1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.c3 d5. With this move, Black ignores the hanging pawn to open lines for their own pieces. The black pawn on d5 also attacks White's undefended pawn on e4.
The game usually continues with White capturing the d5-pawn. From there, point Black can recapture with4...Qxd5, since White can't gain a tempo developing their knight to c3, or develop their knight with4...Nf6.
The Danish Gambit was first analyzed by a Danish player called Blankensteiner in 1830. Later, another Dane player further popularized the opening by employing it in the international tournament of Paris in 1867.
Later, players likeAlexander Alekhine,Joseph Henry Blackburne, andFrank Marshallused the opening. However, the gambit fell in popularity around the 1920s, when more players learned how to defend with Black.
Nowadays, the opening is rare among the chess elite. Yet, you can still see aggressive players employing the Danish Gambit at lower levels.

## Dutch Defense
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Dutch-Defense)
The Dutch Defense might look like a reverse version of the Sicilian (1.e4 c5) - since both moves use a wing-pawn to mechanically prevent the creation of the 'perfect pawn center' by White. But due to the king positions, the Dutch is very different. 1...f5 gains space on the kingside at the expense of some weaknesses.
TheDutch Defensetraditionally begins1.d4 f5. Black sometimes plays1...e6followed by2...f5in order to avoid the Staunton Gambit.
The course of a typical Dutch Defense game is largely defined by Black's pawn structure. Afianchettoon the kingside with a pawn on d6 is the Leningrad; the c6-d5-e6-f5 structure is the Stonewall; and d6-e6-f5 is the hallmark of the Classical Dutch.
There are also a couple of important sidelines by White to know.
The Leningrad Variation is characterized by Black fianchettoing the dark-squared bishop and playing ...d6 to develop the light-squared bishop. The key position can be reached by several move orders, most commonly 1.d4 f52.g3 Nf6 3.Bg2 g6 4.Nf3 Bg7 5.O-O O-O 6.c4 d6. White often plays d5 at some point to control the hole created on e6 when Black plays both ...d6 and ...f5.
Even though the Leningrad is more common, perhaps no variation is more associated with the Dutch than the Stonewall, where Black tries to lock down the e4 square to occupy it with a knight and spearhead a kingside attack.
Once again several move orders are possible, for example 1.d4 f5 2.g3 Nf6 3.Bg2e6 4.c4 d5 5.Nf3 c6.
The most classic example of a Stonewall where Black plays the knight to e4 and wins on the kingside was this game fromSavielly TartakoweragainstGeza Maroczyin 1922. (Both players earned thetitleofgrandmasterwhen it was officially introduced in 1950.)
When Black neither fianchettoes on the kingside nor plays ...c6 and ...d5 it is considered the classical line, usually beginning with the move order 1.d4 f5 2.g3 Nf6 3.Nf3 e6 4.c4Be7(instead of 4...d5).
The Hopton Attack is simply2.Bg5on move two, with White's idea being to eliminate Black's knight when it moves to f6, so that it can't later jump to e4 as in the Stonewall.
This variation is also important because it introduces the possibility of a trap that every Dutch Defense player should know: 1.d4 f5 2.Bg5 h6 3.Bh4 g5 4.Bg3 f4 5.e3 fxg3?? 6.Qh5#. Black can easily avoid the trap by not trying to win the bishop, which is a plan that is doomed to fail, and focusing on development instead. The trap is still a good example of how 1...f5 is a somewhat weakening move.
The Staunton Gambit,2.e4, used to be thought to lead to a very strong attack for White, to the point where Black started to play1...e6and2...f5to avoid it.
Even though the gambit doesn't score well for White anymore, Black might still want to avoid it; the main idea of the Dutch is to attack the kingside, and so Black can get uncomfortable when White tries to do so instead.
However, in the 1...e6 move order Black must be prepared for 2.e4 anyway, when the game has transposed into theFrench Defense.
Unlike several openings, the Dutch doesn't have a clear philosophical origin or a period of exceptional popularity. For centuries now it's been a somewhat offbeat but ever-present way for Black to meet 1.d4.
Paul Morphy often played it on those rare occasions he faced a 1.d4 opening. Of the official world champions GM Mikhail Botvinnik is best known for employing it.
The heyday for the opening was probably the 1920s, when Tartakower won the game above andAlexander Alekhine(in 1922) and GMMiguel Najdorf(1929) also scored famous Dutch Defense victories.

TheDutch Defenceis achess openingcharacterised by the moves:
Black's 1...f5 stakes a claim to the e4-square and envisions an attack in themiddlegameon White'skingside; however, it also weakens Black's kingside to an extent (especially the e8–h5 diagonal).[1]Like its 1.e4 counterpart, theSicilian Defence, the Dutch is an aggressive and unbalancing opening, resulting in the lowest percentage of draws among the most common replies to 1.d4.[2]Historically, White has tried many methods to exploit the kingside weaknesses, such as theStaunton Gambit(2.e4) and Korchnoi Attack (2.h3 and 3.g4).
The Dutch has never been a main line against 1.d4 and is rarely seen today in high-level competition, although a number of top players, includingAlexander Alekhine,Bent Larsen,Paul Morphy,Miguel Najdorf, andHikaru Nakamura[3]have used it with success. Its most notable use may have been in 1951, when bothworld championMikhail Botvinnikand his challenger,David Bronstein, played it in their1951 World Championship match.
Elias Stein(1748–1812), anAlsatianwho settled inThe Hague, recommended the defence as the best reply to 1.d4 in his 1789 bookNouvel essai sur le Jeu des échecs, avec des réflexions militaires relatives à ce jeu.[4]
Siegbert Tarraschrejected the opening as unsound in his 1931 workThe Game of Chess, arguing that White should reply with theStaunton Gambit, with White being better after 2.e4 fxe4 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 c6 5.f3!exf3.[5]
White most oftenfianchettoesthe king's bishop with g3 and Bg2. Black also sometimes fianchettoes the king's bishop with ...g6 and ...Bg7 (theLeningrad Dutch), but may instead develop the bishop to e7, d6 (after ...d5), or b4 (the latter is most often seen if White plays c4 before castling). Play often runs 2.g3 Nf6 3.Bg2 e6 4.Nf3 (4.Nh3!?is also possible, intending Nf4–d3 to control the e5-square  Black plays theStonewall Variation) 4...Be7 5.0-0 0-0 6.c4 and now Black chooses between 6...d5 (the characteristic move of the Stonewall), 6...d6, theIlyin-Zhenevsky Variation(less popular today), or Alekhine's move 6...Ne4!? retaining the option of moving the d-pawn either one or two squares.
The opening's attacking potential is shown in thePolish Immortal, in whichMiguel Najdorf, using the Stonewall Variation, sacrificed all of hisminor piecesto win bycheckmate.
The Stonewall Dutch enjoyed a resurgence of interest in the 1980s and 1990s, when leadinggrandmasters(GMs)Artur Yusupov,Sergey Dolmatov,Nigel ShortandSimen Agdesteinhelped develop the system where Black plays an earlier ...d5 and places his dark-squared bishop on d6.[6]Termed theModern Stonewall, this setup has remained more popular than the traditional early ...Be7.
Magnus Carlsenhas used the Stonewall to score wins againstViswanathan Anand[7]andFabiano Caruana.[8]
Simon Williamsis one of the leading practitioners of the classical Dutch[citation needed]and wrote more than one book on the opening.[9]
The traditional move order involves White playing 2.c4. More commonly, White will start with 2.g3. Some common variations are: c4 is played after g3 and Bg2; c4 is played after Nf3; and c4 is played after 0-0.
Examples:
White has various more aggressive alternatives to the standard moves, including
Black sometimes starts with the move order 1...e6 to avoid these lines, although Black must then be ready to play theFrench Defenceif White continues 2.e4, rendering the Dutch no longer an option. The Staunton Gambit remains a good choice of opening for White in blitz tournaments where Black has little time to ponder the most accurate defense.
TheEncyclopaedia of Chess Openings(ECO) has twenty codes for the Dutch Defence, A80 through A99.

## Elephant Gambit
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Kings-Pawn-Opening-Kings-Knight-Elephant-Gambit)
In his Chessable courses, GMSam Shanklandsays that any opening named after an animal is bad. The Elephant Gambit may be "Dumbo" to a super grandmaster. However, as a surprise weapon, it can stampede a chess player caught unaware. Here are the key points you need to know about this popular Black opening:
The Elephant Gambit arises after the moves 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3d5!?What are the pros and cons from Black's perspective?
Of course, the only way to refute a gambit is to accept it.  After 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d5?!, the Elephant Gambit has three key variations:
The Paulsen Countergambit is named afterLouis Paulsen, a 19th-century master from Germany. After 3.exd5, Black plays 3...e4 to kick the king's knight from its defensive position and attack the kingside.
The Maroczy Gambit is named after GMGeza Maroczyfrom Hungary. After 3.exd5, Black plays 3...Bd6 to develop rapidly the kingside and protect the e5-pawn.
Another variation in the Elephant Gambit is when White plays 3.Nxe5 instead of 3.exd5.
In a casual game in 1863,Wilhelm Steinitz, the first world chess champion, fell victim to the Elephant Gambit. It may be a dubious opening, but if a world champion can lose to it so can you!
GMMikhail Tal, the eighth world chess champion, fared better than Steinitz. In the following game, Tal gave a masterclass on how to dismantle the Elephant Gambit.
If you enjoy the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the Elephant Gambit and find success with it in your games, there's nothing wrong with using it as part of your repertoire. However, if your goal is to improve your overall understanding of chess and develop a more solid foundation, you may want to explore other openings that have stood the test of time.

## English Opening
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/English-Opening)
The English Opening is a flank opening where White advances their c-pawn two squares instead of the d- or e-pawns. The English is a highly transpositional opening, meaning that in many cases the game will reach the same position that arises from other openings and through different move orders. The English Opening is most suitable for intermediate and advanced players and demands more understanding of positional concepts.
A respectable opening, the English has been adopted by several elite players. Among them are former world champions GMsMikhail Botvinnik,Garry Kasparov, and even the 1.e4-devoteeBobby Fischer.
TheEnglish Openinghappens when White starts the game with the move1.c4. White refrains from moving their d and e-pawns and instead uses a flank pawn to control the center.
White's first move allows for more versatile play with the center pawns by both sides. The game mainly revolves around who will get to solidify their grip over the center of the board.
Usually, White will play with a Sicilian-like setup with colors reversed or the game will transpose into a queen's-pawn opening. The latter is another reason behind White's move: it avoids or limits Black's responses to some defenses against 1.d4 openings.
As mentioned, the English is a highly transpositional opening. For this reason, it has few independent variations. However, that doesn't mean that it is light in theory. Due to its positional nature and the many transpositions that can occur, White must know what they're doing to employ this opening successfully. Below you can see the main variations in the English Opening.
Reversed Sicilian games start after Black plays the move...e5, either after1.c4 e5or after delaying the e-pawn thrust for a few moves. As the name suggests, White will play a Sicilian-like setup with an extra tempo.

The Four Knights Variation happens after the moves1.c4 e5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.Nf3 Nc6. Black's setup is flexible and allows for counterattacks. They will usually exchange their dark-squared bishop for White's c3-knight or play against White's Sicilian Dragon setup down a tempo.
The Bremen System occurs after1.c4 e5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.g3. White accelerates the development of their light-squared bishop, trying to increase their control over the central light-squares. They can also use this variation to limit Black's options and later transpose to other lines of the Four Knights'.
The Botvinnik System is a development setup that White can adopt when playing the English. As a system, this development scheme works against many different moves Black chooses to play in the opening.
Its basic setup involves building a pawn triangle on the c4, d3, and e4-squares, controlling the d5 square, and tying up Black's pieces. White also places a knight on c3, fianchettoes a bishop on g2, and castles kingside. Move order is not as important in this system as long as White reaches the final setup.
The Botvinnik System is easy to learn but still has some sting. White can go for a kingside mating attack, playing in the center with a powerful knight on d5, or even play on the queenside. On the other hand, Black can get a good game if they can exploit the holes left by White's pawn play, especially in the d4-square.
The Closed Variation starts with the moves1.c4 e5 2.Nc3 Nc6when Black plays as White would play a Closed Sicilian. White usually dominates the queenside while Black gets counterplay on the kingside. The way players develop their kingside knight impacts the rest of the game significantly.
The Symmetrical English is the umbrella of openings that arise after1.c4 c5. From there, the game can transpose into numerous variations of the Sicilian Defense or other openings.
The Symmetrical, Four Knights' Variation starts after1.c4 c5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nc3 Nc6. In this variation, one of the players will usually push their d-pawn forward two squares, and players will battle for the control of the central squares.
The Ultra-Symmetrical line starts with the moves1.c4 c5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.g3 g6 4.Bg2 Bg7. Both players fianchetto their kingside bishop to discourage their opponents from pushing the d-pawn. This variation usually leads to slow, maneuvering games.
The Hedgehog Defense is a solid way for Black to deal with the English. It starts after the moves1.c4 c5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nc3 e6 4.g3 b6 5.Bg2 Bb7 6.O-O Be7, when Black accepts a cramped position to later counterattack at the right moment. Black usually exchanges their c-pawn for White's d-pawn, lines up a queen and rook on the semi-open c-file, and develops their pieces behind their pawns. Black's play revolves around making use of their pieces' dynamic potential.
The English Opening receives its name fromHoward Staunton, the famous English master. Staunton played1.c4six times againstPierre de Saint Amantin their unofficial world championship match. However, the opening didn't become popular until Botvinnik started using it in the 1930s.
The English hit its peak during the 1960s through the 1980s after elite players started using it regularly. Some of its adopters were GMsTigran Petrosian,Jan Timman, and Kasparov. Even Fischer, who almost always preferred 1.e4 openings, employed the English to win a game against GMBoris Spasskyduring their world championship match.
From the 1990s onward, the popularity of the English has slightly declined. However, the opening is still played frequently and is part of many world-class players' opening repertoire.

TheEnglish Openingis achess openingthat begins with the move:
Aflank opening, it is the fourth most popular[1][2]and, according to various databases, one of the four most successful of White's twenty possible first moves.[1][3]White begins the fight for thecentreby staking a claim to the d5-square from the wing, inhypermodernstyle. Although many lines of the English have a distinct character, the opening is often used as atranspositionaldevice in much the same way as 1.Nf3 – to avoid such highly regarded responses to 1.d4 as theNimzo-IndianandGrünfeldDefences – and is considered reliable and flexible.[4]
The English derives its name from the leading 19th century English masterHoward Staunton, who played it during his 1843 match withSaint-Amantand atLondon 1851, the first international tournament.[5]It did not inspire Staunton's contemporaries and caught on only in the twentieth century.[5]It is now recognised as asolidopening that may be used to reach both classical andhypermodern chesspositions.Mikhail Botvinnik,Tigran Petrosian,Anatoly Karpov,Garry Kasparov,Magnus Carlsen, andDing Lirenhave employed it during their world championship matches.Bobby Fischercreated a stir when he switched to it from his customary1.e4late in his career, employing it againstLev PolugaevskyandOscar Pannoat thePalma de MallorcaInterzonalin 1970, and inhis world championship matchagainstBoris Spassky.
Opening theoreticians who write on the English Opening divide it into three broad categories, generally determined by Black's choice of defensive setup.
The Symmetrical Defence[6](classified A30–39 inECO) is 1...c5, and is so named because both of the c-pawns are advanced two squares, maintaining symmetry. Note that Black can reach the Symmetrical Defence through many move orders by deferring ...c5, and often does. For example, 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 (or 2.Nf3) c5.
Either player may make an early break in the centre with the d-pawn.
Similar to theOpen Sicilian, an early d2–d4 for White can arise on the third move in the Symmetrical Defence with 2.Nf3, where Black has chosen one of 2...Nc6, 2...e6, 2...d6, or 2...g6.
After 3.d4, the game usually continues with 3...cxd4 4.Nxd4. The games can give a large variety of positional and tactical ideas, and can transpose into variants of the Open Sicilian involving theMaróczy Bind, such as theAccelerated Dragon, Taimanov, Kan, or Kalashnikov Variations, if White plays e4 in a later move. If Black manages to play d5 before White plays e4, then the game could transpose into variants of theQueen's Gambit Declined.
When Black plays 2...Nf6, these lines are often called the Anti-Benoni, since these positions are often reached after the transposition 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.Nf3, where White avoided theBenoni Defensethat would arise after 3.d5. After 3...cxd4 4.Nxd4, Black could follow up with 4...e5 forcing White's knight to go to the queenside and avoiding the transpositions to the Sicilian or the QGD; however, White could avoid the line by first playing 3.Nc3 and then play 4.d4, if Black doesn't play 3...d5 (see below). Same as above, the position could transpose into a Queen's Gambit Declined or an Open Sicilian involving the Maróczy Bind.
There are several types of positions that can arise from the Symmetrical Defence. Among the ideas are:[7]
The Reversed Sicilian (classified A20–29 inECO) is another broad category of defence, introduced by the response 1...e5. Note again, that Black can delay playing ...e5, for example 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.Nf3 e5 whereupon even though ...e5 has been delayed, once it is played the defence is classified as a Reversed Sicilian.
After 1...e5, White has Black's position in theSicilianbut with an extratempo. This is often called the ReversedSicilian,[9]though others call it the King's English.[10]Bruce Leverett, writing the English chapter inMCO-14, stated, "It is natural to treat the English as a Sicilian reversed, but the results are often surprising—main lines in the Sicilian Defence correspond to obscure side variations in the English, and vice versa."
The third broad category consists of the non-...e5 and non-...c5 responses, classified A10–19 inECO. Most often these defences consist of Nf6, e6, and d5 or Bb4 systemic responses by Black, or aSlav-like system consisting of c6 and d5, a directKing's Indian Defencesetup with Nf6, g6, Bg7, 0-0, after which c5 and e5 are eschewed, or 1...f5, which usually transposes to aDutch Defenceonce White plays d4. All irregular responses such as 1...b6 and 1...g5 are also lumped into this third broad category.
If White plays an early d4, the game will usually transpose into either theQueen's Gambitor anIndian Defence.
For example, after 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 g6 3.d4 d5 the game has transposed into theGrünfeld Defence, usually reached by the move order 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5.
White can, however, also play 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 g6 3.e4, making it impossible for Black to reach a Grünfeld, instead more or less forcing them into lines of theKing's Indian Defencewith 3...d6. Black also cannot force a Grünfeld with 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 d5, since White can deviate with 3.cxd5 Nxd5 4.g3, a line played several times byMikhail Botvinnikin 1958, in his final match for the world championship withVasily Smyslov.
Instead of playing an early d4, White can also play Nf3 andfianchettotheking's bishop(g3 and Bg2), transposing into a Réti Opening.
Also, after 1.c4 c6, White can transpose into thePolish Opening, Outflank Variation, by playing 2.b4!?, which can be used as a surprise weapon if Black does not know very much about the Polish Opening.[19]
The many different transpositional possibilities available to White make the English a slippery opening for Black to defend against, and make it necessary for them to consider carefully whatmove orderto employ. For instance, if Black would like to play aQueen's Gambit Declined(QGD), the most accurate move order to do so is 1...e6 2.d4 d5. (Of course, White can again play the Réti instead with 2.Nf3 d5 3.b3.) If Black plays instead 1...Nf6 2.Nc3 e6, White can avoid the QGD by playing 3.e4, theFlohr–Mikenas Attack.
TheEncyclopaedia of Chess Openingshas classified the English Opening under the codes A10 through A39:
The English Opening is used byProfessor Moriartyin the filmSherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadowsas he and Holmes discuss their competing plans over a game of chess.  Both Holmes and Moriarty eventually play the final movesblindfoldedby citing out the last moves indescriptive notation(rather thanalgebraic, as the former was contemporary in the late 19th century), ending in Holmes checkmating Moriarty, just asWatsonfoils Moriarty's plans.

The Evans Gambit - named after Captain William Davies Evans, who first played it in 1827 - is a pawn sacrifice. White gambits the b4 pawn to gain time attacking the black piece which captures it, and take over the center with c2-c3 and d2-d4.

# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evans_Gambit)

TheEvans Gambitis achess openingcharacterised by the moves:
The Evans Gambit is an attacking line of theGiuoco Piano. White offers a pawn to divert the black bishop on c5. If Black accepts, White can follow up with c3 and d4, ripping open thecentre, while also opening diagonals to play Ba3 or Qb3 at some point, preventing Black from castlingkingsideand threatening the f7-pawn, respectively. If Black declines, the b4-pawn stakes outspaceon the queenside, and White can follow up with a4 later in the game, potentially gaining atempoby threatening to trap Black'sdark-square bishop.
According toReuben Fine, the Evans Gambit poses a challenge for Black since the usual defences (playing ...d6 and/or returning the gambit pawn) are more difficult to achieve than with othergambits. (Fine was once beaten by this gambit in afriendly gameagainstBobby Fischer, in just 17 moves.[1])
TheEncyclopaedia of Chess Openingshas two codes for the Evans Gambit, C51 and C52.
The gambit is named after the Welsh sea captain,William Davies Evans, the first player known to have played it. The first game with the opening is considered to be Evans–McDonnell, London 1827, although in that game a slightly different move order was tried (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.0-0 d6 and only now 5.b4). In his monthlyChess Lifecolumn,Andrew Soltiscommented that Evans was "the first player to be widely honored for an opening weknowhe played".[2]
The first analysis of the gambit was published in theSecond Series of Progressive Lessons(1832) byWilliam Lewis.[3]The gambit became very popular and was played several times in the series of games between McDonnell andLouis de la Bourdonnaisin 1834. Players includingAdolf Anderssen,Paul MorphyandMikhail Chigorinlater took it up. TheEvergreen Gamewon by Adolf Anderssen againstJean Dufresneopened with the Evans Gambit. Eventually, however, the second world chess championEmanuel Laskerdealt a heavy blow to the opening with a modern defensive idea: returning the pawn under favourable circumstances. The opening was out of favour for much of the 20th century, althoughJohn NunnandJan Timmanplayed it in some games in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and in the 1990s,Garry Kasparovused it in a few games (notably a famous 25-move win againstViswanathan AnandinRiga, 1995[4]), which prompted a brief revival of interest in it.
The most obvious and most usual way for Black to meet the gambit is to accept it with 4...Bxb4,[5]after which White plays 5.c3 and Black usually follows up with 5...Ba5 (5...Be7 and the less common 5...Bc5 and 5...Bd6, the Stone–Ware Defence, are also played). White usually follows up with 6.d4.Emanuel Lasker's line is 4...Bxb4 5.c3 Ba5 6.d4 d6 7.0-0 Bb6 8.dxe5 dxe5 9.Qxd8+ Nxd8 10.Nxe5 Be6. This variation takes the sting out of White's attack by returning the gambit pawn and exchanging queens, and according to Fine, the resulting simplified position "is psychologically depressing for the gambit player" whose intent is usually an aggressive attack. Chigorin did a lot of analysis on the alternative 9.Qb3 Qf6 10.Bg5 Qg6 11.Bd5 Nge7 12.Bxe7 Kxe7 13.Bxc6 Qxc6 14.Nxe5 Qe6, which avoids the exchange of queens, but reached no clear verdict. Instead White often avoids this line with 7.Qb3 Qd7 8.dxe5, when Black can return the pawn with 8...Bb6 or hold onto it with 8...dxe5, though White obtains sufficientcompensationin this line.
Alternatively, Black can meet 6.d4 with 6...exd4, when White can try 7.Qb3, a move often favoured byNigel Short. 7.0-0 is traditionally met by 7...Nge7, intending to meet 8.Ng5 or 8.cxd4 with 8...d5 returning the pawn in many lines, rather than thematerialistic7...dxc3, which is well met by 8.Qb3 with a very dangerousinitiativefor thesacrificedpawns.  Alternatively, 7...d6 8.cxd4 Bb6 is known as theNormal Position, in which Black is content to settle for a one-pawn advantage and White seeks compensation in the form ofopen linesand a strong centre.
Alternatively, the gambit can be declined with 4...Bb6, when 5.a4 a6 is the normal continuation. But due to the loss oftempoinvolved, most commentators consider declining the Evans Gambit to be weaker than accepting it and returning the pawn at a later stage. Black can also play the rare Countergambit Variation (4...d5), but this is thought to be dubious.
Aron Nimzowitschstates in the bookMy System, however, that by declining the gambit Black has not lost a tempo, since the move b4 was, in the sense of development, unproductive,
as is every pawn move, if it does not bear a logical connection with the centre. For suppose after 4...Bb6 5.b5 (to make a virtue of necessity and attempt something of a demobilizing effect with the ill-moved b-pawn move), 5...Nd4 and now if 6.Nxe5, then 6...Qg5 with a strong attack.[6]
After 4.b4 Bxb4 5.c3, the bishop must move or be captured. The common retreats are listed here, with the good and bad sides of each:
Black's most popular retreat according toChessgames.com. It gets out of the way of White's centre pawns, and pins the c3-pawn if White plays 6.d4, but it has the drawback of removing the a5-square from the blackqueen's knight. Black usually subsequently retreats the bishop to b6 to facilitate ...Na5, which is particularly strong when White opts for the Bc4, Qb3 approach.
The second most popular retreat according to Chessgames.com, with White scoring better than after 5...Ba5. This is often played by those unfamiliar with the Evans Gambit, and is arguably inferior to 5...Ba5, because 6.d4 attacks the bishop again and limits Black's options as compared with 5...Ba5 6.d4.
The Anderssen Variation has often been considered one of the "safer" retreats and has been played byViswanathan Anand. After 6.d4 Na5 White can attempt to maintain an initiative with 7.Be2 as played by Kasparov, or immediately recapture the pawn with 7.Nxe5.
The Stone–Ware Defence, named after Henry Nathan Stone andPreston Ware, reinforces the e5-pawn and has been played by severalgrandmasterssuch asAndrei Volokitin,Alexander GrischukandLoek van Wely.
The Mayet Defence, named afterCarl Mayet, is played very rarely as it undevelops a good bishop.

## Falkbeer Counter-Gambit
# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Gambit,_Falkbeer_Countergambit)
TheFalkbeer Countergambitis achess openingthat begins:
In this aggressivecountergambit, Black disdains thepawnoffered as asacrifice, instead opening thecentreto exploit White's weakness on thekingside. After the standard capture, 3.exd5, Black may reply with 3...exf4,transposinginto theKing's Gambit Accepted, 3...e4, or the more modern 3...c6.
A well-known blunder in this opening is White's reply 3.fxe5??, which after 3...Qh4+, either losesmaterialafter 4.g3 Qxe4+,forkingthe king and rook, or severely exposes the white king to the black pieces after 4.Ke2 Qxe4+ 5.Kf2 Bc5+.
The opening bears the name of Austrian masterErnst Falkbeerwho played it in an 1851 game againstAdolf Anderssen.[1]TheEncyclopaedia of Chess Openingscodes for the Falkbeer Countergambit are C31 and C32.
In this variation, Black'scompensationfor the sacrificed pawn primarily consists of his lead indevelopment, coupled with the exposure of White's king. A typical line may run: 4.d3 Nf6 5.dxe4 Nxe4 6.Nf3 Bc5, where Black aims for the weakness on f2. InMaehrisch-Ostrau1923, a game betweenRudolf SpielmannandSiegbert Tarraschcontinued: 7.Qe2 Bf5 (this was condemned by theHandbuch des Schachspielsbecause of White's next, though Black had already gotten into difficulties in the gameRéti–Breyer, Budapest 1917, where 7...f5 8.Nfd2 Bf2+ 9.Kd1 Qxd5 10.Nc3 was played) 8.g4?!(in retrospect, prudent was 8.Nc3) 8...0-0!9.gxf5 Re8 and Black has a tremendous position, as he is bound to regain material and White's positional deficiencies will remain.[2]
This line fell out of favour afterWorld War II, as Black encountered difficulties, with players eventually turning to the next idea.
This has become the most commonly played move after 3.exd5, with its most notable advocate beingJohn Nunn. It is usually attributed toAron Nimzowitsch, who successfully played it inSpielmann–Nimzowitsch, Munich 1906.[3]Frank Marshallactually introduced the move to master play, however, at Ostend 1905, defeatingRichard Teichmannin 34 moves.[4][5]Annotating that game in his 1914 bookMarshall's Chess "Swindles", Marshall described his 3...c6 as "An innovation."[6]
Although Black won both of those games, 3...c6 languished in obscurity for many years thereafter. White can respond with 4.Qe2, despite the drastic defeat inflicted on the youngAlexander AlekhinebyPaul Johnerat Carlsbad 1911, although 4.Nc3 exf4 is much more common. The resulting positions are analogous to theModern Defence of the King's Gambit Accepted, in which White strives to utilise his 4–2queensidepawnmajority, with Black relying on his piece activity and cramping pawn at f4 to play against White's king.Theoryhas not reached a definitive verdict, but the resulting positions are believed to offer Black more chances than 3...e4.

Okay so basically the Falkbeer counter gambit goes 1. e4 e5 2. f4 d5 3. exd5 e4
Looks like maybe you should get a book on the KG. You won't get many good, in-depth answers from a chess.com forum.
And honestly, if you're studying this for use as black (which appears you are) I wouldn't spend to much time on it, not many people play the King's gambit. But what do I know, I play 1. ..c5. Do you see the KG a lot?
Never mind what the book line is. Just play the best you can from here. You already achieved your objective... to derail the KG. If you aren't playing mano a mano from here out and your opponent so prepared that he already has a fatal trap in mind then dealing with one extra move isn't going to help you.
4. Bb5+ is worth considering.
There is a line in the Falkbeer Counter Gambit in which black just pushes the e-pawn ( 3. ... e4 ) and is willing to sac it should white attack it with the d-pawn ( 4. d3 ) by pushing it even further ( 4. ... e3 ). I encountered this line in the demo version of some chess teaching program. Being two pawns down is not that great I thought to myself. But the Kings Gambit came up in a recent sudden death game of mine and I decided to give it a try. My opponent seemingly unfamiliar with the position chose to attack the pushed pawn with the knight instead. The result was shocking:

It may be that the Falkbeer Counter Gambit is objectively somewhat more favourable to white than some other defenses to the Kings Gambit but in a quick game it seems far more playable since black has a very comfortable development and not many issues that need long thinking ( not to mention the element of surprise ).
1.e4 e5 2.f4 d5 3.exd5 e4? loses.
3...c6 and 3...exf4 are only moves. 3...exf4 is better.
Looks like maybe you should get a book on the KG. You won't get many good, in-depth answers from a chess.com forum.
Seconded, except for the typo in "[m]any".
Interestingly the Falkbeer transposes to the Scandinavian Defense in some lines. So you might also like to look at the Scandinavian. It is always helpful not to just look at opening lines in books but to go through entire games from databases which show you how the masters handled the resulting middle and end games.
3... exf4 is the engine's top move. Why play 3... e4 ?

## Four Knights Game
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Four-Knights-Game)
The Four Knights is a double king pawn opening in which both players develop their knights to ideal squares, pointed towards the center. Formerly considered a bit of a dinosaur, this opening has become somewhat popular again recently; it can lead to either sharp attacks or closed, maneuvering struggles.

# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Knights_Game)
TheFour Knights Gameis achess openingthat begins with the moves:
This is the most common sequence, but theknightsmaydevelopin any order to reach the same position.
The opening is fairly popular with beginners who strictly adhere to the opening principle: "Develop knights beforebishops." It was one of the workhorses in the family of theOpen Game, at even the highest levels, until World War I. Thereafter it fell by the wayside, along with a number of other Open Games. In this period ambitious players explored theRuy Lopez, believing it a better attempt byWhiteto exploit theadvantage of the first move. In the 1990s, this opening saw a renaissance, and is now seen in thepraxisof players from beginner tograndmaster.
The Four Knights usually leads to quietpositional play, though there are somesharpvariations. TheEncyclopaedia of Chess Openingshas three codes for the Four Knights Game:
White's most common move is 4.Bb5, theSpanish Variation. This variation can also be reached from theRuy Lopez, Berlin Defence. After 4.Bb5,Blackhas four major alternatives.
If White plays 4.d4, theScotch Four Knights Gamearises. This leads to a moreopen position, which can also be reached from theScotch Game, e.g. 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3. This variation was played in thefifth gameof the 1996Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparovmatch.
One reason White may choose the Four Knights (3.Nc3) move order over the Scotch (3.d4), besides fearing that after 3.d4 exd4 4.Nxd4 Black may choose 4...Bc5 or 4...Qh4, is that White may want to play the Belgrade Gambit (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.d4 exd4 5.Nd5!?). It is not possible to reach the Belgrade from the Scotch; however, the Belgrade is a distant second in popularity to 5.Nxd4.
A further possibility is 4.Bc4, theItalian Four Knights Game, or Prussian Four Knights Game, popular in the 1880s, though this line is regarded as inferior according to Pinski, and an outright mistake byIMLarry D. Evans.[3]Black can preserve the symmetry by 4...Bc5, leading to the quietGiuoco Pianissimo. A better move order for White that leads to this position is via theGiuoco Pianoby 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.Nc3 Nf6. The line is a favourite among younger players due to its simple and easy development, but was also used successfully byNigel ShortagainstAntoaneta Stefanova.[4]
The problem with playing for this position via the Four Knights Game is that after 4.Bc4, Black can perform the center fork trick by pseudo-sacrificinga knight with 4...Nxe4!. Then 5.Bxf7+?, though superficially attractive, relinquishes the bishop pair and central control to Black. After 5...Kxf7 6.Nxe4 d5 7.Neg5+ Kg8, Black is already threatening 8...e4, and after 8.d3 h6 9.Nh3 Bg4, Black has a very powerful position, with an unopposed light-squared bishop, a strong duo of pawns in the centre, and a safe king, while White needs to work out how to get the displaced knight on h3 into play; often it will need to be played back to g1.
Rather than 5.Bxf7+?, a better chance for White to play forequalityis 5.Nxe4, even though 5...d5 regains the piece with a good game, e.g., 6.Bd3 (6.Bxd5? Qxd5 7.Nc3 Qd8Estrin; 6.Bb5?!dxe4 7.Nxe5 Qg5!Collijn'sLärobok; 6.d4 dxc4 7.d5 Ne7 8.Nc3 c6 Cordel–Schupli, 1905) 6...dxe4 (the recently discovered 6...Nb4 is also playable) 7.Bxe4 Bd6 8.d4 Nxd4 9.Nxd4 exd4 10.Qxd4 0-0 11.Be3 (11.0-0??Bxh2+ wins) Qe7 (Tartakower–Atkins, London 1922[5]) and now the natural 12.0-0 Be5 would be awkward for White.[6]In the above line, more ambitious is 8...exd4 9.Nxd4 0-0!?, as in a match game betweenSiegbert TarraschandEmanuel Laskerin 1916, which led to a Black win in 23 moves.[7]
Another try is 5.0-0!?transposingto a variation of theBoden–Kieseritzky Gambit.
Igor Glekhas favoured 4.g3, preparing development of the bishop to g2. According to Pinski, Black's main responses are 4...Bc5 and 4...d5, both of which are reckoned to equalize for Black. A Halloween Gambit style 4...Nxe4 has also been tried at the grandmaster level as in two games betweenIlya SmirinandBartłomiej Macieja.[8]
Though rarely seen, this move is playable. For example, if Black plays 4...Bb4, White has the responses 5.Nd5, 5.0-0, and 5.d3, which retain equality with accurate play.
The quietwaiting move4.a3, theGunsberg Variation, is a specialty of PolishgrandmasterPaweł Blehm.
A dubiousgambitis 4.Nxe5?!, the so-calledHalloween Gambit. After 4...Nxe5 5.d4, White tries to seize the centre with his pawns and drive the black knights back to their home squares. GrandmasterLarry Kaufmansays that this line is refuted by 5...Nc6 6.d5 Bb4! 7.dxc6 Nxe4 8.Qd4 Qe7, which he attributes to Jan Pinski.[9]According toMax Euwe's opening series volume 11, Black has a decisive advantage after 5...Ng6 6.e5 Ng8 7.Bc4 d5 8.Bxd5 c6.[10]

## French Defense
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/French-Defense)
The French Defense is one of the most popular Black responses to 1.e4. It has consistently been a part of masters' repertoire since the 1800s and one of the favorites of positional players. Usually leading to slower games, this opening is a good choice for players of all levels.
TheFrench Defensestarts after1.e4 e6. Black's move by prepares the d7-d5 push to challenge White's center immediately. 1...e6 also opens lines for Black's dark-squared bishop and queen, an advantage over the Caro-Kann and Slav Defense (where Black also plays for the d7-d5 push).
The downside to 1...e6 is that Black imprisons their light-squared bishop, something that doesn't happen in the Caro or Slav.
The French Defense usually leads to closed, slow games, where piece maneuvering and pawn breaks are of the utmost importance.
Like many other classical openings that have been around for a long time, the French Defense has a lot of theory behind it. Below you can read about the most popular variations of this opening:
The Tarrasch is one of the most popular variations of the French, and it starts after1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nd2.White's 3.Nd2 avoids the pin on the knight after Black's common 3...Bb4 (Winawer Variation, discussed below). White opts for a more solid approach to face the French, aiming for a slight but safe advantage.
Another variation that enjoys much popularity, the Winawer starts with the moves1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4. Black plays for positional imbalances, usually exchanging the dark-squared bishop for the c3-knight. After that, White will have the choice of playing either a tactical or a more positional game. These are the trickiest and most tactical lines in the French Defense.
The Classical French was the most popular way to respond to the French at the beginning of the 20th century. White would play for a strong center with the f2-f4 push, sometimes followed up by long castling and expansion on the kingside. The Classical French occurs after1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5.

The game enters the Advance variation after the moves1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.e5. This line usually involves a positional struggle in closed positions, where White will try to play on the kingside, and Black will play on the queenside.
The Exchange Variation of the French happens after1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5. This continuation results in an equal position, giving this line the reputation of being drawish. In fact, most of the games do end in draws, with Black having a slight edge over White in decisive games.
The well-prepared White player should score well against the French Defense. Most of the popular lines in this opening have White winning or drawing most of the games. The variations below show promising results for White.
The Tarrasch Variation scores well against the French Defense, with White winning 42%, drawing 30%, and losing 28%. The White player can develop sensibly and use their central pawn wedge to their favor. White avoids the Winawer lines and is prepared for a semi-open or fully open position.

If you enjoy playing closed positions, the Advance Variation is a good pick for you. White's 3.e5 shuts down the center immediately. White's pawn chain will lead them to attack on the kingside, while Black will go for queenside activity. White outscores Black in these lines, which generally lead to tense maneuvering positions.

The French Defense is one of the oldest openings in chess. The opening's name comes from an 1834 correspondence game between the London Chess Club and the Paris Chess Club. Although it has never surpassed other openings as Black's primary response to 1.e4, the French Defense has always been present in top games.
Some of the strongest players in history have included the French Defense in their repertoire.Akiba Rubinstein,Aron Nimzowitsch, GMMikhail Botvinnik, GMTigran Petrosian, GMViktor Korchnoi, and GM Wolfgang Uhlmann were a few of the top players of the past who played the French regularly. Contemporary grandmasters who also make consistent use of this opening includeEvgeny BareevandAlexander Morozevich.

## Fried Liver Attack
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/article/view/fried-liver-attack-chess-opening)
TheFried Liver Attackholds the award for the coolest opening name in chess. This variation of the Two-Knights Defense involves a bold knight sacrifice which forces the black king to take a walk. This variation is also known as theFegatello Attack, an Italian term which means "dead as a piece of meat!"

The key position in the Fried Liver Attack.
Let's take a look at what moves bring about this opening:
It is easy to see from the above position that Black's king is walking on thin ice. Many brilliant games have been played in this variation. Let us take a look how Paul Morphy crushed his father Alonzo Morphy when he was only thirteen years old!

The great Paul Morphy.
This opening variation is still alive and kicking today at the amateur and grandmaster level. For the last game, we will look at a more recent example between two 2600-level players. Even though this game was played over 200 years after the Morphy game, you can see the dangerous attack crashing through for White. Note: The black player was one of Magnus Carlsen's first coaches!
TheFried Liver Attackis a fun way to go after the king with a knight sacrifice if Black boldly takes the pawn on d5.

# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Italian-Game-Fried-Liver-Attack)
TheFried Liver Attackis one of the variations of theItalian Game, a 1.e4 opening. It's an aggressive opening in which White sacrifices a knight to gain the initiative and lure the black king to the middle of the board. It's uncommon to see the Fried Liver played by masters, and at the top level, Black avoids this line. However, it's an important line of the Italian Game and a must-know variation for those who play it (or against it).
The Fried Liver starts after the moves1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.Ng5 d5 5.exd5 Nxd5 6.Nxf7. White sacrifices a knight, with no viable way for Black to decline it.
After Black captures the knight with the king, White's idea is to bring the queen out with 7.Qf3+. With this move, White checks the enemy king and adds another attacker to the black d5-knight, forcing the Black's king to go to e6 to defend the piece.
There is only one viable (and rather counterintuitive) line for Black to play the Fried Liver; all the other options lose instantly. Below you can see Black's correct continuation and a few of the other most common and losing lines.
Black's only way to survive the Fried Liver is with the line1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.Ng5 d5 5.exd5 Nxd5 6.Nxf7 Kxf7 7.Qf3+ Ke6. Black moves the king toward the center of the board because it's the only way to save the d5-knight.
After this, Black's only plan is to consolidate their position—a task that computers can pull off but proves to be very difficult for humans.
Many club players who don't know theory play1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.Ng5 d5 5.exd5 Nxd5 6.Nxf7 Kxf7 7.Qf3+ Qf6. Black blocks the check and offers a queen trade, which would benefit them since they are currently a piece up. However, White can simply regain the piece with 8.Bxd5+ and gain a winning position with an extra pawn and a safer king.
Another common mistake Black can make is playing1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.Ng5 d5 5.exd5 Nxd5 6.Nxf7 Kxf7 7.Qf3+ Ke8. Black gives the piece back and retreats the king to a seemingly safer place. However, the extra pawn and a much better position give White a winning advantage.
Another mistake for Black is taking the line1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.Ng5 d5 5.exd5 Nxd5 6.Nxf7 Kxf7 7.Qf3+ Kg8. Surprisingly, this is the fourth most common move among club players, even though it leads to checkmate.
The Fried Liver variation of the Italian Game is one of the oldest openings in chess, with records dating back to the 1600s. In fact, one of the most famous games with this opening happened in 1610 between Giulio Cesare Polerio and Domenico.
Many theories try to explain why this variation is called the "Fried Liver." Some sources indicate that Italians called this opening the "fegatello," which literally translates to "little liver." However, there is no clear explanation of how that expression came to refer to this opening.

## Giuoco Piano
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/article/view/giuoco-piano-chess-opening)
TheGiuoco Pianois a popular chess opening from the beginner levels all the way up to grandmaster.Giuoco Pianotranslates from Italian into the "quiet game". First, let's take a look at the beginning moves that make up this opening.
TheGiuoco Pianois a great opening since it follows the three pillars of opening strategy.
1. Control the center- Starting with 1.e4 controls the center and opens up the diagonals for the bishop and the queen.
2. Develop pieces- White quickly develops the kingside pieces to their best squares.
3. Protect the king- On move four, White is ready to castle.
TheGiuoco Pianohas been around in written examples as early as the 16th century! It reached its maximum popularity in the 19th century under great players such as Steinitz, Morphy, and Anderssen. Here is a game by the first world champion Wilhelm Steinitz showing the power of this opening.
1st World Champion Wilhelm Steinitz
To show you that theGiuoco Pianois still alive and kicking lets fast forward to modern times to see how the current World Champion Magnus Carlsen handles this opening.

# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuoco_Piano)
TheGiuoco Piano(Italianfor 'Quiet Game';pronounced[ˈdʒwɔːkoˈpjaːno])[1]is achess openingbeginning with the moves:
"White aims to develop quickly – but so does Black. White can construct apawn centrebut in unfavourable conditions a centre which cannot provide a basis for further active play."[3]
The name "Italian Game" is also commonly used;[4]however, that name is sometimes used instead to describe all openings starting 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4, including 3...Nf6 (theTwo Knights Defence) and other less common replies.
The Giuoco Piano is assigned codes C50 to C54 in theEncyclopaedia of Chess Openings.
The Giuoco Piano is one of the oldest recorded openings. The Portuguese writerPedro Damianoplayed it at the beginning of the 16th century and the ItalianGrecoplayed it at the beginning of the 17th century. The Giuoco Piano was popular through the 19th century, but modern refinements in defensive play have led most chess masters towards openings like theRuy Lopezthat offer White greater chances for long-terminitiative.
In modern play, grandmasters have shown distinct preference for the slower and more strategicGiuoco Pianissimo(4.d3, or 4.c3 Nf6 5.d3).Anatoly Karpovused the Giuoco Pianissimo againstViktor Korchnoitwice in the 1981 World Championship match, with both games ending in adraw;[5][6]Garry Kasparovused it againstJoël Lautierat Linares 1994, resigning after 29 moves;[7]Vladimir Kramnikchose it againstTeimour Radjabovat Linares (2004);[8]Viswanathan Anandused it to defeatJon Hammerin 2010;[9]Magnus Carlsenused it againstHikaru Nakamuraat London 2011, winning in 41 moves[10]andIan Nepomniachtchiused it against Magnus Carlsen in the 2021 World Championship match, losing in 49 moves.[11]
The main continuations on White's fourth move are:
Other continuations are:
White plays 4.c3 in preparation for the central advance d2–d4. The main reply 4...Nf6 was first analysed byGrecoin the 17th century. Alternatives include 4...Qe7, with the intention of holding on to the centre.
5.d4 exd4 6.cxd4
6...Bb4+
7.Nc3 Nxe4 8.0-0(diagram)
8...Bxc3! 9.d5
9...Bf6
10.Re1 Ne7 11.Rxe4 d6 12.Bg5 Bxg5 13.Nxg5 h6!
14.Bb5+
14...Bd7 15.Qe2 Bxb5 16.Qxb5+ Qd7 17.Qxb7
17...0-0 18.Rae1 Rab8 19.Qxa7 Nxd5 20.Qd4 Qf5 21.Nf3 Rb4
If White does not want togambitmaterial, 7.Bd2 is a good alternative. The game could continue 7...Bxd2+ (Kaufman recommends 7...Nxe4!?8.Bxb4 Nxb4 9.Bxf7+ Kxf7 10.Qb3+ d5!? [10...Kf8 11.Qxb4+ Qe7 12.Qxe7+ Kxe7 is safer, reaching an equalendgame] 11.Ne5+ Ke6! 12.Qxb4 c5!?) 8.Nbxd2 d5 9.exd5 Nxd5 10.Qb3 Nce7 (10...Na5 is an alternative, inviting a repetition of moves after 11.Qa4+ Nc6 [threatening 12...Nb6] 12.Qb3 Na5) 11.0-0 0-0 12.Rfe1 c6. In this position White has more freedom, but theisolated d-pawncan be a weakness. 7.Nbd2 is also a viable move for White, although this still only offers approximate equality. It has not been a popular choice among human players, but it seems to be recommended by computer engines.[18]7.Kf1?! has been largely abandoned.[19]
Black can try to hold astrongpointin the centre at e5 with 4...Qe7, a move which first appeared in theGöttingen manuscriptaround 1500.[20]After 5.d4 (5.0-0 usually transposes) Bb6,  White's options include 6.0-0, 6.d5, 6.a4 and 6.Bg5.[21]A typical continuation is 6.0-0 d6 7.a4 a6 8.h3 Nf6 9.Re1 0-0 (Leonhardt–Spielmann, Ostend 1907).[22]
4...Bb6 usually transposes after 5.d4 Qe7.
Other 4th moves for Black are considered inferior.
With 4.d3, White plays the Giuoco Pianissimo (Italian: "Very Quiet Game", a name given byAdolf Anderssen).[23]White aims for a slow buildup, deferring thepushto d4 until it can be prepared. By avoiding an immediate confrontation in the centre, White prevents the early release oftensionthrough exchanges and enters a positional maneuvering game. 4.Nc3 Nf6 5.d3 is the Giuoco Pianissimo Deferred.[24]4.d3 f5 is the not-so-quiet Lucchini Gambit; there can follow 5.Ng5 f4, theDuboisVariation.[25]
If White plays c2–c3, the position can take some characteristics of theRuy Lopezif the bishop retreats to c2 via b3. This idea has been taken up by some grandmasters, such asAnish Giri, to avoid the drawishBerlin Defencein the Ruy Lopez. White can also play b4 and a4, chasing the Black bishop and staking outspaceon thequeenside. Despite its slow,drawishreputation, this variation became more popular after being taken up byJohn Nunnin the 1980s. The common move orders are 4.c3 Nf6 5.d3 (ECOC54), and transposition from theBishop's Opening: 2.Bc4 Nf6 3.d3 Nc6 4.Nf3 Bc5 5.c3 or 5.0-0 d6 6.c3.

# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6ring_Attack)

TheGöring Attackis achess openingcharacterised by the moves:
The Göring Attack is a variation of theEvans Gambit(4.b4). After the Evans Gambit is accepted (4...Bxb4) and the riposte (5.c3) has prompted the defensive 5...Bc5 (the second most popular retreat), play continues until 10.Bg5, the defining move of the Göring Attack. It is named afterCarl Theodor Göring, who played it in several games againstJohannes Minckwitzin 1869. The Göring Attack came into fashion afterMikhail Chigorinplayed it againstWilhelm Steinitzin 1883. We are told Tchigorin scored his most brilliant successes with this variation.[1]Modern Chess Openingsdescribes it as a "tricky" opening, "which can be refuted only if you know the right moves".[2]

## Grand Prix Attack
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/blog/RussBell/fighting-the-sicilian-with-the-grand-prix-attack)
TheGrand Prix Attack (1.e4 c5 2.Nc3 -or 2.f4)is an aggressive, yet sound, opening for White against the Sicilian Defense.  White intends to play the game on his/her terms, avoiding Black's intentions of playing the myriad, heavily theory-laden, so-calledOpen Sicilianvariations.  The Grand Prix Attack (GPA) typically features an early f4 by White, preparing a King-side attack.  This anti-Sicilian weapon is easier to learn compared to many other White responses to the Sicilian Defense, and is well suited for the fast time control games - bullet, blitz and rapid.
The following two gamesillustrate typical thematic attacking schemes for White in the GPA.Note especially the opening-up of attacking lines, typically on the Kingside, whenWhite employs all of his pieces in the attackand demolition of the Black King's defenses, so that the inevitable coup de grace may be delivered by the major pieces, Queen and rooks...
The following game illustrates the original, sharpBc4 variationof the GPA.Along with Mark Hebden, Julian Hodgson was a major contributor to the development of the theory of the GPA in the 1970's and 80's when they popularized the opening while successfully playing it on theEnglish Chess Federation Grand Prix chess circuitin the UK during that period...
https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1885372


The following game illustrates the so-called "modern", positionalBb5variationof the GPA.In fact, on p.149 of his book"Starting Out: Sicilian GPA"(see*below), Gawain Jones, a foremost authority on the GPA, states"3.Bb5 is the best scoring line for White in the Grand Prix Attack."...

Bookson Sicilian Grand Prix Attack
For those just starting out learning the Grand Prix Attackthe first two books below, by Vincent Moret and Gawain Jones, stand out...
My First Chess Opening Repertoire for Whiteby Vincent Moret...
Moret's book is a complete introductory opening repertoire for White based on 1.e4, covering Black's major replies.  In particular, for our purposes, his choice against the Sicilian Defense is the Grand Prix Attack.The presentation and instruction on the GPA are outstanding.Moret goes to lengths to explain, teach, the themes and plans for White, including not only WHAT to play, but also the detailed procedures for HOW to play against Black's typical responses.I highly recommend this as a first book for learning the GPA - the instruction on the GPA alone is easily worth the price of the book.See my review of the book (as 'RLBell")here.  The book is also available as a course onChessable.
*Starting Out: Sicilian Grand Prix Attackby Gawain Jones...
Thorough, very instructive coverage of the Grand Prix Attack, written by a foremost authority on the GPA.  IMO it is the best introductory, stand-alone book on this opening.This book is essential if you intend to play the GPA seriously, even if you also own Moret's book.Also available ineBook formatand inpdf format.
Some games from the book...

The Grand Prix Attack: Attacking Lines with f4 Against the Sicilianby Gary Lane...
Another good collection of annotated GPA games.  Available inpdf format.
The Grand Prix Attackby Evgeny Sveshnikov...
An interesting and relatively advanced book of deeply annotated GPA games.  Sveshnikov (after whom a well-known variation of the Sicilian Defense is named) is a recognized expert and long-time practitioner of the GPA, and a staunch proponent of the move 2.f4 (as opposed to 2.Nc3), the case for which he attempts to make via the majority of games featuring this move order in the book.
***********************************
As White against 1.e4 e5 -The Vienna Game & Gambit !
If you enjoy playing theGrand Prix Attackas White against the Sicilian Defense (1.e4 c5),there is a good chance you might like playing theVienna Game & Gambitas White against 1.e4 e5.
For an aggressive yet sound White response to1.e4 e5I suggest to check out my blog article...
Introduction To The Vienna Game & Gambit...
https://www.chess.com/blog/RussBell/introduction-to-the-vienna-game-gambit
In particular you will notice thatWhite's first several moves in the Vienna Game & Gambit are the same as for the Grand Prix Attack(1.e4 / 2.Nc3, followed soon thereafter by f4).
While these openings are different by virtue of Black's first move, since White's first few moves are typically the same in both openings there is some commonality not only in the setup but also in the fact that for both openings White's intention is to launch a kingside attack, which is the point of the aggressive placement of the f4 pawn in both openings.
These similarities suggest that what one learns in terms of strategies and tactics from one opening may, in many situations, prove useful when playing the other opening as well.  The commonalities also imply that in terms of a 1.e4 opening repertoire for White it should be more productive and efficient to study these two openings than two totally dissimilar openings, with completely different pawn structures, strategies and tactics.It is for all these reasons that I chose to create the articles on these two openings.

## Grob Attack
# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grob%27s_Attack)
Grob's Attackis an unconventionalchess openingin which White begins with the move:
Although it has acult following, it is widely considered to be one of the worst possible first moves for White.International Master(IM)John Watsonwrites, "As far as I can tell, 1 g4 is competitive with 1 h4 for the honour of being White's worst first move. Against an informed or skilled opponent, it is simply masochistic."[1]
The opening takes its name from Swiss IMHenri Grob(1904–1974) who analysed it extensively and played hundreds ofcorrespondence gameswith it. In Grob's newspaper column analysis of this opening, he referred to it as theSpike Opening, a name which is still used occasionally. Other early references used the nameAhlhausen's Opening, after Carl Ahlhausen (1835–1892) ofBerlin, one of the first to play 1.g4.Savielly Tartakowersometimes played this opening insimultaneous exhibitionsand called it theGenoaorSan Pier D'Arena Opening, after the city and suburb ofGenoawhere he first used it.  In theCzech RepublicandSlovakia, 1.g4 is calledFric's Opening,[citation needed]and in other parts of the world it is calledKolibri's Opening.
Along with several other uncommon first moves for White, the Grob is classified under the code A00 ("irregular openings" or "uncommon openings") in theEncyclopedia of Chess Openings. White has three main plans: to support the g4 pawn with h3; pressure against d5 or on the h1–a8 diagonal, preventing Black from playing ...Bxg4 (e.g. 1.g4 d5 2.Bg2 Bxg4 3.c4, exploiting the pin against the b7-pawn); or advancing the h-pawn in akingsideattack.[2]
Perhaps the highest-profile game to feature the Grob was whenMichael Basmandefeated grandmaster and renowned theoristJohn Nunnwith it in 1978.[3]The Grob was also forced uponAnatoly Karpovby former Soviet premierMikhail Gorbachevin a friendly match againstSusan PolgarinLindsborg, Kansas2005. Gorbachev made the ceremonial first move and played 1.g4. Normally players can simply retract ceremonial moves they do not like. In this case Gorbachev insisted Karpov play on, saying he wanted to "cause some difficulties for the older player."[4][5]
The Grob was included in the opening book for the superfinal of the 12thTop Chess Engine Championshipseason (April–July 2018). Both finalists,StockfishandKomodo, evaluated the position after 1.g4 as providing a clear advantage for Black, and both failed to defend the White position.[6]
IMMichael BasmanandGrandmasterSpyridon Skembrisare advocates of the opening. It has a certain surprise value, and the average player is unlikely to know how to refute it and more likely to get overconfident and make mistakes. Moreover, the lack of theory along this line may negate the repertoire of an experienced opponent. Intuitive play by  Black can lead into dangerous traps.  Many of these traps rely on Black's replying with 1...d5, attacking the pawn with hisqueen's bishop. White can sacrifice the pawn with 2.Bg2 Bxg4 3.c4 with Qb3 to follow, giving White some pressure against the weakened squares d5 and b7.

Black is not obliged to give White these opportunities. In response to Grob's Attack, Black may also play 1...e5. Good responses would be 2.Bg2 (dominating the light-squared centre diagonal) or 2.c4, the English Variation, preparing Nc3 to solidify White's control of d5. After 1...e5, Black can take aim at the h4-square, left weak by White's pawn advance.  2.Bg2 h5 will force a weakening of White's pawn structure. 2.d3 (intending to answer 2...h5 with 3.g5) or 2.h3 can be answered by 2...Ne7 with the threat of ...Ng6 followed by ...Nf4 or ...Nh4, disrupting White's kingsidefianchetto.[7]
Another frequently used setup for White in the Grob is 1.g4, 2.h3, and 3.Bg2. A Black counter-setup might be 1...d5, 2...e5, and 3...c6 (these moves may be played in any order), which, if used in conjunction with an eventual ...e4, negates White'sking bishop's influence over the centre.
A key element of the Grob is deploying the king's bishop on g2 and having itrule the diagonal. In order to further this goal, White must keep the centre clear of pawns. This leads to frequent "tearing at the centre" with c4 often being White's third move.
Due to the unusual pawn structure White attains by playing g4 and c4 so early in the game, there is frequently little advantage tocastling. Play often devolves into a wild and wide-open game, with a definitive advantage usually resolving itself in the first 20 moves.
Black responding to any opening move by White with 1...g5 is called the "Borg Defence",[8]Borg being the reverse spelling of Grob. If played specifically in response to 1.e4, it is also called the Basman Defence, after Michael Basman.

## Grunfeld Defense
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Grunfeld-Defense)
The Grunfeld Defense is a cousin of the King's Indian Defense after1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3where Black strikes in the center with3...d5instead of playing 3...Bg7. In the King's Indian, Black is often playing for a kingside attack, while the Grunfeld is more confrontational in the center. White might get a central pawn mass, but Black plans to strike it down.
TheGrunfeld Defenseappears after the moves1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5.
The theme of any variation of the Grunfeld is White's center vs. Black's efforts to take it down. The two main variations are the Exchange and the Russian, but there are others worth knowing too.
The most popular and theoretically important Grunfeld is the Exchange Variation, which continues4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.e4 Nxc3 6.bxc3. The simplest plan for Black, if White allows it, is to continue with ...c5, ...Nc6, ...Bg7, and sometimes ...Bg4 to pin the white knight to the queen, all of which put pressure on the d4 square. White usually seeks rapid development and active play to compensate, sometimes sacrificing the a-pawn.
This line is highly theoretical, which makes it more popular at the highest levels of chess.

The main alternative to 4.cxd5 for White is4.Nf3which Black usually follows with4...Bg7, after which White has three options. The Russian Variation is5.Qb3, protecting the c-pawn (5.e3is another popular move which does so, but blocks in the dark-squared bishop), adding to control of d5. Play continues5...dxc4 6.Qxc4with7.e4to follow, and White gets the big center, although Black can pester the queen and chip at that center with the moves ...a6, ...b5, and ...c5.
Instead of the Russian, White can play GMTigran V. Petrosian's move,5.Bg5, which is equally popular. The typical continuation is5...Ne4 6.cxd5 Nxg5 7.Nxg5 e6, where White gives up the two bishops but leads in development. White is also now able to defend the d-pawn with e3 while not blocking in the dark-squared bishop.
On move five White can also play5.Bf4, the Hungarian Attack, or the aforementioned5.e3, the Burille Variation.
White can also play4.Bf4on move four, the Brinckmann Attack, where play usually continues4...Bg7 5.e3 O-O. This continuation is called the Grunfeld Gambit because White can win a pawn, but usually only temporarily, as in the continuation below.
4.Bg5on move four, the Stockholm Variation, is essentially a gambit for White with the usual continuation4...Ne4 5.Bh4 Nxc3 6.bxc3 dxc4 7.e3 Be6.
4.Qb3is the Accelerated Russian but usually transposes to the standard Russian.
The rare Zaitsev Gambit,4.h4, scores 48% for White in just over 100 games.
It is also worth noting that, because the Exchange Variation of the Grunfeld has a good reputation for Black, White sometimes makes third moves besides 3.Nc3 to avoid it. When Black replies 3...d5 anyway, these are called "Neo-Grunfelds". The three main alternative third moves for White are3.Nf3,3.f3, and3.g3.
Most of Black's control over the course of the game is over right after 3...d5, with White's setup determining action from there. It's still significant; the Grunfeld is safer for Black than the King's Indian, giving up the occasional win in order to draw more and lose less. Per 100 games, Black scores +27 -36 =36 with 3...d5 compared to +29 -43 =28 with 3...Bg7.
And at the same time, because 3...d5 is such a committal move, most of White's responses score similarly. The percentages are identical for 4.cxd5 and 4.Nf3 (37% for White, 27% for Black, 36% drawn), moves which represent three-quarters of all Grunfeld games. The Accelerated Russian Variation (45% win rate for White) and the Zaitsev Gambit (48%) score better, but represent only a small fraction of games.
White's best chance is potentially the anti-Grunfeld move 3.f3, 3500 games winning 44% of the time. In some ways, a Grunfeld player has already obtained all their goals after 3.Nc3 d5.
The Grunfeld Defense is named for GM Ernst Grunfeld, a leading opening theorist of his day. He began playing it in several games in 1922, including a win overAlexander Alekhinewith it in Vienna (which apparently made enough of an impression on Alekhine that he tried it himself in the same tournament, only to lose in 26 moves).
It wasEfim Bogoljubovagainst Alekhine who introduced the Grunfeld to world championship play in 1929, but he only scored =1 -2. In 1935, Alekhine played it vs. Euwe and managed just +1 -3. In fact, the Grunfeld has scored surprisingly poorly in world championship play, but that is just one event. It has been respected for almost a century and no less a player than GMGarry Kasparovwas a longtime practitioner. Several other top grandmasters use it to this day.
One of the most famous games in chess history, especially in the United States, was 13-year-old future GMBobby Fischer's "Game of the Century" over IM Donald Byrne in 1956. The game did not start as a Grunfeld but transposed into one on Fischer's 5...d5, and the prodigy went on to sacrifice his queen in one of the greatest attacks ever played on a chess board.
GMAlexei Shirovdefeated GMVeselin Topalovwith the Black side of a Grunfeld at the 1998 Linares tournament. The game is best-known for its ending, however, andShirov's astounding 47th move.
[GMGarry Kasparovplayed almost every opening he tried well, but especially the Grunfeld. Watch him at the peak of his powers, dismantling the great GMAlexander Beliavskyin 1988.
As he demonstrated in games like that one,] Kasparov was a longtime expert in the Grunfeld. That made it all the more shocking when GMVladimir Kramnikdefeated him in the second game of their world championship match in 2000, a match Kramnik went on to win.

The Grunfeld is one of the more active ways for Black to meet 1.d4, although it requires good theoretical knowledge to play well. Find out about more moves and approaches in ourChess.com Explorer.

TheGrünfeld Defenceis achess openingcharacterised by the moves:
Black offers White the possibility of 4.cxd5, which may be followed by 4...Nxd5 and 5.e4, giving White an imposingcentral pawnduo. If White does not take the d5-pawn, Black may eventually play ...dxc4, when a White response of e4 again leads to the samepawn structure. In classical opening theory this imposingpawn centrewas held to give White a large advantage, but thehypermodernschool, which was coming to the fore in the 1920s, held that a large pawn centre could be a liability rather than an asset. The Grünfeld is therefore a key hypermodern opening, showing in stark terms how a large pawn centre can either be a powerful battering ram or a target for attack.
The first instance of this opening is in an 1855 game byMoheschunder Bannerjee, an Indian player who had transitioned fromIndian chessrules, playing Black againstJohn Cochranein Calcutta, in May 1855:
and Whitematesin three (19.Nh6+double checkKh8 20.Qg8+ Rxg8 21.Nf7#).[1][2]Cochrane published a book reporting his games with Moheshchunder and other Indians in 1864.
It gained popularity afterErnst Grünfeldintroduced it into international play at the Bad Pistyan Tournament 7-28 April 1922, where, in his first game with the defense, he drewFriedrich Sämischin 22 moves.[3]Later the same year on November 18, 1922,Ernst Grünfelddefeated future world championAlexander Alekhinein Vienna in 55 moves.[4]Grünfeld usually employed a very classical style. The defence was later adopted by a number of prominent players, includingVasily Smyslov,Viktor Korchnoi,Leonid SteinandBobby Fischer.Garry Kasparovoften used the defence, including in hisWorld Championshipmatches againstAnatoly Karpovin 1986, 1987 and 1990, andVladimir Kramnikin 2000. Currently active notable players who employ the opening includeMagnus Carlsen,Maxime Vachier-Lagrave,Loek van Wely,Peter Svidler,Peter Leko,Viswanathan Anand,Luke McShane,Ian NepomniachtchiandGata Kamsky.[5]Anand employed it twice in theWorld Chess Championship 2010. In theWorld Chess Championship 2012between Anand andBoris Gelfand, each player used the Grünfeld once with both games ending in draws. Anand faced the Grünfeld againstMagnus Carlsenduring the first game of theWorld Chess Championship 2014and drew in a Rook and Queen ending.
TheGame of the CenturybetweenDonald Byrneand 13-year-old Bobby Fischer on October 17, 1956, featured this opening, although arriving in the Grünfeld via atranspositionof moves (using 1.Nf3 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.d4 0-0 5.Bf4 d5).
The main line of the Grünfeld, theExchange Variation(ECOcodes D85–D89), is defined by the continuation 4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.e4. Now White has an imposing looking centre – and the main continuation 5...Nxc3 6.bxc3 strengthens it still further. Black generally attacks White's centre with ...c5 and ...Bg7, often followed by moves such as ...Qa5, ...cxd4, ...Bg4 and ...Nc6. White often uses their big centre to launch an attack against Black's king. One subvariation, frequently played by Karpov, including four games of his 1987 world championship match against Kasparov inSeville, Spain, is the Seville Variation, after 6...Bg7 7.Bc4 c5 8.Ne2 Nc6 9.Be3 0-0 10.0-0 Bg4 11.f3 Na5 12.Bxf7+, long thought a poor move by theory, as the resultant dark-square weakness had been believed to give Black more than enoughcompensationfor the pawn.
White candeveloptheir pieces in a number of ways in the Exchange Variation. For decades, theory held that the correct method of  development was with Bc4 and Ne2, often followed by 0-0 and f4–f5, playing for a central breakthrough or kingside attack. It was generally thought that an early Nf3 was weak in the Exchange Variation because it allowed Black too much pressure on the centre with ...Bg4. In the late 1970s, however, Karpov, Kasparov and others found different methods to play the Exchange Variation with White, often involving an early Rb1 to remove the rook from the sensitive a1–h8 diagonal, as well as attempting to hinder the development of Black'squeenside. Another, relatively recently developed system involves quickly playing Be3, Qd2 and Rc1 or Rd1 to fortify White's centre, remove White's rook from the diagonal and possibly enable an early d5 push by White.
Vladimir KramnikandBoris Gelfandare the leading practitioners as White, andĽubomír Ftáčnikhas had many fine results with the black pieces.[5]
In bringing more pressure to bear against Black's central outpost on d5, White practically forces ...dxc4, thus gaining a central preponderance; however, in return, their queen will often be exposed as Black's queenside play unfolds in the middlegame. After 5...dxc4 6.Qxc4 0-0 7.e4 Black has several primary options:
The Hungarian Variation, 7...a6, has been championed byPeter Leko.
Named afterVasily Smyslov, 7...Bg4 8.Be3 Nfd7 was a topical line from the 1950s through the mid-1970s.
7...Na6 isLodewijk Prins's idea, which Kasparov favoured in several of his World Championship matches against Karpov.[6]
This line is commonly seen in recent games.[7]After 7...Nc6, White will most commonly play 8.Be2, followed by 8...e5! 9.d5 Nd4 10.Nxd4 exd4 11.Qxd4. A pawn sacrifice to develop Black's pieces and generate active counterplay.
7...c6, 7...b6
In this line, favoured byYasser Seirawan, after the nearly universal 5...Ne4, White plays 6.Bh4 or 6.cxd5, with Black then opting for either 6...Nxc3 7.bxc3 dxc4 or 6...Nxg5 7.Nxg5 e6. In the latter case, 7...c6 is sometimes tried. 6.Nxd5?grabbing the pawn loses a piece after 6...Nxg5 7.Nxg5 e6. After 6.cxd5 Nxg5 7.Nxg5 e6, White has 8.Qd2 exd5 9.Qe3+, with attacking chances (though the interpolation 8...h6 9.Nf3 exd5 is a significant alternative), or the more usual 8.Nf3 exd5 after which play generally proceeds on lines analogous to theQueen's Gambit Declined, Exchange Variation, with a queenside minority attack by White (b2–b4–b5xc6), as Black aims for their traditional kingside play with f7–f5–f4 and, in this case, g6–g5.
For players who do not wish to take on the complexities of the Exchange Variation, the move 4.Bf4 is generally considered a safer continuation for White.[8]White opts for the initiative on the queenside with a smaller pawn centre. In the main line (D82), play proceeds with 4...Bg7 5.e3 c5 6.dxc5 Qa5, with White's choices at their seventh move being cxd5, Qb3, Qa4, or Rc1. Despite its reputation, instatistical databasesthis variation shows only a slightly higher percentage of White wins and draws, as opposed to the Exchange Variation.[9][10]The variation is not often met in top-flight play today, its usage having declined significantly since its heyday in the 1930s.[11][better source needed]
In this variation, play may also continue 4.Bf4 Bg7 5.e3 0-0, which is known as theGrünfeld Gambit(ECOcode D83). White can accept the gambit by playing 6.cxd5 Nxd5 7.Nxd5 Qxd5 8.Bxc7, or decline it with 6.Qb3 or 6.Rc1, to which Black responds with 6...c5.
Systems in which White delays the development Nc3 are known as theNeo-Grünfeld Defence(ECOcode D70–D79); typical move orders are 1.d4 Nf6 2.g3 g6 3.c4 d5 or, more commonly, 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.g3 d5 (the latter is known as the Kemeri Variation).
Apart from the above, among the more popular continuations are:
Smyslov vs. Fischer, Herceg Novi Blitz Tournament, 1970:1.c4 g6 2.g3 Bg7 3.Bg2 Nf6 4.Nf3 0-0 5.0-0 c6 6.d4 d5 7.cxd5 cxd5 8.Nc3 Ne4 9.Qb3 Nc6 10.Be3 Na5 11.Qd1 Nxc3 12.bxc3 b6 13.Ne5 Ba6 14.Re1 Rc8 15.Bd2 e6 16.e4 Bb7 17.exd5 Bxd5 18.Bxd5 Qxd5 19.Qe2 Rfd8 20.Ng4 Nc4 21.Bh6 f5 22.Bxg7 Kxg7 23.Ne3 Nxe3 24.Qxe3 Rc6 25.Rac1 Rdc8 26.c4 Rxc4 27.Rxc4 Rxc4 28.Qxe6 Qxe6 29.Rxe6 Kf7 30.Re3 Rxd4 31.Ra3 a5 32.Rc3 Ke6 33.Kg2 Kd6 34.h4 Ra4 35.Rc2 b5 36.Kf3 b4 37.Ke3 Kd5 38.f3 Ra3+ 39.Kf4 a4 40.g4 fxg4 41.fxg4 b3 42.axb3 axb3 43.Rc7 Ra4+ 44.Kg5 Rb4 45.Rc1 Kd4 46.Kh6 Rb70–1[12]

## Halloween Gambit

# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_Gambit)
TheHalloween Gambit(also known as theMüller–Schulze GambitorLeipzig Gambit) is an aggressivechess openinggambitin which White sacrifices a knight early on for a single pawn. The opening is an offshoot of the normally staidFour Knights Gameand is defined by the moves:
The theoreticianOskar Cordelreported in 1888 thatLeipzigclub players used the opening to dangerous effect, but he did not believe it wassound.  Their name for it,Gambit Müller und Schulze, was not after any players by those names, but rather a jocular German equivalent of "Smith and Jones" or "Tom, Dick, and Harry". The modern name "Halloween Gambit" was given by the German player Steffen Jakob, who explained that "Many players are shocked, the way they would be frightened by a Halloween mask, when they are mentally prepared for a boring Four Knight's, and then they are faced with Nxe5."[1]
White's objective is to seize thecenterwith pawns and drive back Black's knights.  After 4... Nxe5, White usually plays 5. d4 (5.f4 does nothing fordevelopment), after which Black can retreat the attacked knight to either g6 or c6.
When Black retreats 5...Ng6, White chases the f6-knight with 6.e5. Then after 6...Ng8 7.Bc4, former world championMax Euwerecommended 7...d5 8.Bxd5 c6, contending in volume 11 of his opening series that Black has a decisive advantage.[1]GMLarry Kaufmanrecommends instead 8...N8e7 in this line, but prefers the 5...Nc6 lines, saying that 5...Ng6 "should also be good but is unnecessarily risky".[2]
Instead of holding on to the extra piece with the usual 6...Ng8, a more logical continuation according toEric Schilleris 6...Bb4, giving Black the better game after 7.exf6 Qxf6 with a lead in development and pressure in the center.[3]
When Black retreats 5...Nc6, White chases the knight again with 6.d5. Then Black has 6...Ne5 (the Main line), or 6...Bb4 (Pinski's move).
After 6...Ne5, White chases again with 7.f4. Then after 7...Ng6 the game usually continues 8.e5 Ng8 9.d6 cxd6 10.exd6 (see diagram). In this case White's attack is very dangerous, and likely to prevail in practical play, with the threat of Nb5–c7 difficult to defend satisfactorily. Precise defense may theoretically preserve Black'smaterialadvantage but White has achieved their opening objectives.
GMLarry Kaufmanwrote in 2004 that the Müller–Schulze Gambit isrefutedby 4...Nxe5 5.d4 Nc6 6.d5 Bb4!7.dxc6 Nxe4 8.Qd4 Qe7, which he attributes to the PolishIMJan Pinski.[4][5]In 2003, Pinski analyzed 9.Qxg7 (there is also the defensive resource 9.Be3 and after 9...0-0 10.Bd3 Nxc3 11.bxc3 Bd6 12.cxb7 Bxb7 13.0-0 White has equalized the material but Black has more open lines and can take control quicker being a tempo up; Kaufman wrote in 2020 that after 13...Rfe8 14.Rab1 Bc6, "White has no compensation for his poor pawn structure")[2]9...Nxc3+ 10.Be3 Nd5+ 11.c3 Rf8 12.cxb4 Nxe3 13.fxe3 Qxb4+, concluding "Black is very close to winning".[6]
A similar gambit can be tried by Black: after 4.g3, Black can play 4...Nxe4!?This line is arguably sounder than its White counterpart because White's 4.g3 has weakened the f3-square. Moreover, White cannot play the line recommended by Kaufman with colors reversed, because 5.Nxe4 d5 6.Nc3 d4 7.Bb5?dxc3 8.Nxe5? Qd5 9.Qe2? loses to 9...Qxh1+. However, with the pawn on g3, Nh4 is possible and it should be easier tocastle.[5]
The followingspeed chessgames (played by Brause, a chess computer) show what can befall an unprepared player of the black pieces:
The next game, played in a Halloween Gambit thematic tournament, won the prize for the most spectacular game won by White.

## Italian Game
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Italian-Game)
The Italian Game is one of the oldest openings in chess and has been around for centuries. This classical 1.e4 opening can lead to slower and positional games as well as open, tactical battles. Although very common among beginners, the Italian Game is a part of the repertoire of players of every level.
The Italian Game starts after the moves1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4.White develops their kingside pieces sensibly, with the knight controlling the center and the bishop attacking the weak f7-pawn through the central d5-square.
With this opening, White follows the basic opening principles of fighting for the center and taking care of the king's safety. From there, the game can evolve into either tactical or positional struggles.
As an opening that has been around since the 1500s, masters studied the Italian Game intensely throughout the ages. Below you can see the main variations of this opening.
The most popular variation of the Italian Game is the Giuoco Piano, which starts after1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5. The name of this line is an Italian expression that can translate to "soft game" or "slow game," an indication that this variation often leads to positional games. Despite its name, White can force a more open game by playing 5.d4 and entering the Center Attack variation.
The Giuoco Pianissimo, as the name suggests, tends to lead to a "very slow game." The d2-d3 push characterizes this variation and can happen either through1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.d3or through1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.c3 Nf6 5.d3. With this variation, White keeps the center closed and favors a more positional game.
Popularized by Captain W.D. Evans and used extensively by Paul Morphy, The Evans Gambit is suitable for the aggressive player. White gives up a wing pawn to develop quickly and create a dangerous attack on the enemy king. This variation adds spice to the slower Giuoco Piano after the moves1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.b4. Although not common at the highest levels, the Evans Gambit is one of the best-scoring lines among beginner and intermediate players.
The Italian Game is not one of the most challenging openings to deal with on Black's side.
The Black player who enjoys a positional game can count on the main lines of the Giuoco Piano for a balanced game. Black wins 31% of games, draws 33%, and loses 36% in this line—a more than satisfactory result. Note that if Black chooses this line, they should be prepared for the Evans Gambit.
Although Black can accept the gambit and still get a good game, the Evans Gambit Declined variation scores the best. With 41% of games ending in wins, 23% draws, and 36% losses, Black stands very well after1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.b4 Bb6. The Black player can also rejoice at the fact that this variation scores remarkably well among non-professional players.
The Italian Game is one of the oldest openings in chess, with Italian masters adopting and studying it as early as the 16th century. Notably, Giulio Cesare Polerio analyzed it in his codexes, Pedro Damiano in his 1512 Questo libro e da imparare giocare a scachi et de li partiti, and later Gioachino Greco in his manuscripts.
The opening remained popular throughout the ages, appearing consistently in top-level play. Nowadays, elite players like GMs Anish Giri, Wesley So, and Maxime Vachier-Lagrave are still employing the Giuoco Piano regularly with the white pieces.
As expected of an opening that survived for so long, there are several famous examples of the Italian Game. Below you can see four illustrative examples of this type of opening:
Anderssen vs. Dufresne, 1852 - The Evergreen Game
Steinitz vs. von Bardeleben, 1895
Carlsen vs. Nakamura, 2011
Kasparov vs. Lautier, 1994

# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Game)
TheItalian Gameis a family of chess openings beginning with the moves:
This opening is defined by thedevelopmentof the white bishop to c4 (the so-called "Italian bishop"), where it attacks Black's vulnerable f7-square. It is part of the large family ofOpen Gamesor Double King's Pawn Games.
The Italian Game is one of the oldest recorded chess openings; it occurs in theGöttingen manuscriptand was developed by players such asDamianoandPolerioin the 16th century, and later byGrecoin 1620, who gave the game its main line. It has been extensively analyzed for more than 300 years.
The termItalian Gameis sometimes used interchangeably withGiuoco Piano, although the latter also refers particularly to play after 3...Bc5.[1]
TheEncyclopaedia of Chess Openingsgives the Italian Game ten codes: C50–C54 for the Giuoco Piano, and C55–C59 for the Two Knights Defense. Side lines are covered under C50.
Black's two main options are 3...Bc5, theGiuoco Piano, and 3...Nf6, theTwo Knights Defense. They are about equally popular,[2]but the resulting positions usually have a very different character.
Until the 19th century, this line was the main line of the Italian Game. Dubbed theGiuoco Piano("Quiet Game") in contrast to the more aggressive lines then being developed, this continues 4.d3, the positionalGiuoco Pianissimo("Very Quiet Game"), or the main line 4.c3 (the original Giuoco Piano) leading to positions first analyzed by Greco in the 17th century, and revitalized at the turn of the 20th by the Moller Attack. 4.0-0 will usually transpose into the Giuoco Pianissimo after 4...Nf6 5.d3, while 4.Nc3 Nf6 is atranspositioninto theFour Knights Game.
Another option for White is the aggressiveEvans Gambit(4.b4), a popular opening in the 19th century which is still occasionally played. TheItalian Gambit(4.d4) may transpose into theScotch Gambitafter 4...exd4; however, this move order allows Black the option of 4...Bxd4, so if White wants a Scotch Gambit, 3.d4 is usually preferred. TheJerome Gambit(4.Bxf7+) is unsound.
3...Nf6 is the more aggressiveTwo Knights Defense. This is more in the nature of a counterattack, and some (e.g.Bronstein) have proposed it be renamed so.
If White attempts to exploit the weakness of Black's f7-pawn with 4.Ng5, Black may try the knife-edged Traxler/Wilkes-Barre Variation (4...Bc5!?). After the more common 4...d5 5.exd5, Black generally avoids 5...Nxd5 allowing 6.Nxf7, the Fegatello orFried Liver Attack, or 6.d4, theLolliVariation, both of which are difficult to defend under practical conditions. Most common is 5...Na5, sacrificing a pawn for an active position. The very sharp Fritz Variation (5...Nd4) and the closely related Ulvestad Variation (5...b5) lead to wild positions with little margin for error for either side.
Aquieteroption for White is 4.d3, when Black's main options are 4...Bc5, transposing into the Giuoco Pianissimo, and the solid 4...Be7, which is likely to lead to similar positions to theBishop's Opening.
Alternatively, White can play 4.d4, which may lead to theScotch Gambitafter the usual reply 4...exd4.

## Jerome Gambit
# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Gambit)
TheJerome Gambitis an unsoundchess openingwhich is an offshoot of theGiuoco Piano. It is characterized by the moves:
Whitesacrificestwopieces(and eventually regains one) for two pawns in hopes of exposing Black'skingand obtaining amating attack. The line was a brief fad in the late 19th century, but it is almost never seen today.
The opening is named after Alonzo Wheeler Jerome (1834–1902) ofPaxton, Illinois, who had a game with this opening against the problemistWilliam Shinkmanpublished in theDubuque Chess Journalin 1876.[1]Blackburnewrote of it, "I used to call this the Kentucky opening. For a while after its introduction, it was greatly favoured by certain players, but they soon grew tired of it."[2]Blackburne's name for the opening may have arisen from confusion with1.e4 e5 2.Qh5, which was also published in theDubuque Chess Journaland dubbed the "Kentucky Opening" there.
In the third edition of the openingtreatiseChess Openings, Ancient and Modern(1896), the authors wrote:
The Jerome Gambit is an American invention, and a very risky attack. It is described in the American Supplement toCook's Synopsisas unsound but not to be trifled with. The first player sacrifices two pieces for twopawns, with the chances arising from the adversary's king being displaced, and drawn into the centre of the board.[3]
Similarly,du Montwrote that it "is unsound, but has the saving grace of leading to a lively game and is therefore suitable for an occasional friendly game. The defender cannot afford to be careless."[4]
White may regain one of the two sacrificed pieces with 6.d4, but Black retains a decisivematerialadvantage with 6...Bxd4 7.Qxd4 Qf6.[5]More commonly, White plays 6.Qh5+. In that event, Freeborough and Ranken analyzed two lines. One is 6...Kf8 7.Qxe5 Qe7 8.Qf5+ Ke8 9.Nc3 d6 10.Qf3 Qf7 11.Qe2 Nh6 12.0-0 c6, with large advantage to Black.[5]Freeborough and Ranken also analyze the bold 6.Qh5+ Ke6!?("follow[ing] out Mr.Steinitz'stheory that the King is a strong piece") 7.Qf5+ Kd6 8.d4 (or 8.f4 Qf6 9.fxe5+ Qxe5) Bxd4 9.Na3 c6 10.c3 Qf6 11.cxd4 Qxf5 12.exf5 Nf7 13.Bf4+ Ke7, again with a large advantage.[5]Lines to avoid for Black after 6.Qh5+ are 6...Kf6?? 7.Qf5+ Ke7 8.Qxe5+ Kf7 9.Qxc5 and 6...Ke7?? 7.Qxe5+ followed by Qxc5, both regaining both pieces and winning two pawns.[6]

The Jerome Gambit is typically played 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.Bxf7+ Kxf7 5.Nxe5 Nxe5 6.Qh5+.
Anyone got any ideas on how to succeed with this?
There's very little chances of succeeding with that gambit, 6. .... Ke6 and White doesn't have much for the two pieces. I suggest you find something better.
6. ...Ke6 7. Qf5+ keeps the attack going. 6. ...g6 7. Qxe5 Qe7! is much better, because after 8. Qxh8 Qxe4+ Black has an attack and can almost trap the queen...

1.  "6. ...Ke6 7. Qf5+ keeps the attack going": not really, 7. .... Kd6 8 Nc3 Qf6 and White has nothing.

2. "6. ...g6 7. Qxe5 Qe7! is much better, because after 8. Qxh8 Qxe4+ Black has an attack and can almost trap the queen...": Of course, Black  does better here because you've played a bad move for White:

6. ...g6 7. Qxe5 Qe7 8. Qf4+ is better than taking the Rook.
7. ...Kd6 8. d4! Bxd4 9. Bg5 Ne7 10. Bxe7+ Qxe7 11. Na3 is still probably winning for Black, but offers White practical chances...
6. ...g6 7. Qxe5 Qe7 8. Qf4 Qf6 9. Qxf6+ Nxf6 and White is down a piece AND behind in development!

Look, it doesn't matter how you care to slice it, the gambit is completely unsound. My researches find that the gambit doesn't appear in any master databases. Probably dangerous at the beginner level but not a variation to take anyone's game forward. I stand by my original comment "Find something better".
I still feel that white can salvage the game by playing the Bietschlaap gambit.
If you insist on gambiting away a minor in the first few moves, perhaps the Halloween Gambit is a better place to start.

Agreed, especially as the subject gambit simply throws awaytwominor pieces.
If your pieces are getting in your way, just leave some of them off the board. Few opponents will complain.
I'mthrilledto see some posts on my favorite chess opening and research topic!
I'll try to answer the questions, bit by bit...
The Jerome Gambit can be fun at blitz, in informal games, or when giving odds to a weaker player.
A friend says he plays chess at a local bar and likes the Jerome Gambit because, either way, win or lose, the game is over quickly...
There is no sense in trying to "prove" that the opening is "good": it has many time-tested refutations.
For those playing the Jerome, it becomes as issue of finding the most challenging lines of play, until either the opponent collapses -- or wins.
I am reminded of a 19th century chess book that gave detailed opening analysis of pawn-and-move odds and pawn-and-two-moves odds -- both theoretically "worse" or "lost" for Black -- in order to assist the odds-givers.
If your pieces are getting in your way, just leave some of them off the board. Few opponents will complain.
I think you're on to something here.
I know a number of people who play the Jerome Gambit against players of equal strength, or of greater strength -- something I do rarely.
How many rating points difference is playing the Jerome Gambit worth? From my researches on online Jerome Gambit tournaments (turn-based, club players): Jerome Gambit + 200 points = even chances.
Relevant is Geoff Chandler's off-the-cuff Blunder Table that players under 1500, playing each other, might still get away with the Jerome...
The Jerome Gambit is typically played 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.Bxf7+ Kxf7 5.Nxe5 Nxe5 6.Qh5+.
Anyone got any ideas on how to succeed with this?
I've been blogging about the Jerome Gambit (and its relatives) for over 1,000 consecutive days. There are plenty of tips at:jeromegambit.blogspot.com
Rest assured: all the refutations are there, as well.
There's very little chances of succeeding with that gambit, 6. .... Ke6 and White doesn't have much for the two pieces. I suggest you find something better.
Indeed, 6...Ke6 is one of the strongest replies Black can make.
It takes confidence, though, or some knowledge of the line by the defender. In my games 6...Ke6 was chosen less than 1/4 of the time by Black.
6. ...Ke6 7. Qf5+ keeps the attack going. 6. ...g6 7. Qxe5 Qe7! is much better, because after 8. Qxh8 Qxe4+ Black has an attack and can almost trap the queen...
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.Bxf7+ Kxf7 5.Nxe5+ Nxe5+ 6.Qh5+ g6 7.Qxe5and now7...d6was made famous by Blackburne in a brilliant attacking miniature of the Jerome Gambit:8.Qxh8 Qh4 9.0-0 Nf6 10.c3 Ng4 11.h3 Bxf2+ 12.Kh1 Bf5 13.Qxa8 Qxh3+ 14.gxh3 Bxe4#
The evaluation of7...d6as "Black wins" has been popular, but mistaken. Some writers have pointed out that10.Qd8!is actuallywinning for White-- but that is a mistake, too. Current assessment is that Black can force a draw.
However,7...Qe7, Whistler's Defense (played by Lt. G.N. Whistler against Alonzo Wheeler Jerome in a series of correspondence games in 1876; in later writings Jerome somehow "forgot" to mention this defense), leads to an equally-Blackburnian conflagration after8.Qxh8?as I showed in one of my Jerome Gambit Tournament games (I had the Black pieces):8...Qxe4+ 9.Kd1 Qxg2 10.Qxh7+ Kf8 11.Re1 d5 12.d4 Bg4+ 13.Kd2 Qxf2+ 14.Re2 Qxe2+ 15.Kc3 Qc4+ 16.Kd2 Qxd4+ 17.Ke1 Qd1#
I have a question for you: I have heard it said that the line 1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 Bc5 3. Bxf7+!? is ALSO known as the Jerome Gambit... can you confirm this?
Abrahams inThe Chess Mind(1951) refers to “the once popular Jerome Gambit” –1.e4 e5 2.Bc4 Bc5 3.Bxf7+.Fletcher’sGambits Accepted A Survey of Opening Sacrifices(1954) notes “Some authors have called the opening with the moves1.P-K4, P-K4; 2.B-B4, B-B4; 3.BxPch, by the name Jerome.”
I haven't found any other references (I'd be glad to see them), or any games by Alonzo Wheeler Jerome with the2.Bc4/3.Bxf7+line, either.
This is the case of an unsound gambit. You may surprise some in bullet, that's all. Good luck with it!
a) yes, you are right, it is manifestly unsound
b) certainly in bullet, but also some faster speeds like 3 0 or even 2 12 (I've played 5 12, I think)
c) Pete Banks has played the Jerome Gambit successfully over-the-board in regular club play in the U.K. -- he is much braver than I am.
d) I appreciate all the "good luck" that I can get. As the saying goes, when it comes to the Jerome Gambit, "Black wins by force, White wins by farce."
...Qf6 is often a show stopper in the Jerome Gambit -- exchanging Queens can take the life out of any attack White is trying to whip up.
As for6...Ke6 7.Qf5+ Kd6 8.Nc3 Qf6 --
Some players prefer7.f4instead of the Queen check, but then Black has the profoundly annoying7...d6(a favorite of computers the world over), simply giving back one of the pieces and draining most of the dynamism out of White's game after8.fxe5 dxe5;
I don't have much experience with7.Qf5+ Kd6 8.Nc3, so I'll have to look at that some more. Quite likely, though, as PrawnEatsPrawn says,8...Qf6is strong.
I play7.Qf5+ Kd6 8.f4, but then after8...Qh4+ 9.g3 Nf3+Black is preparing a Queen sac that will crush the first player, as a buddy of mine, Mad Dog Hailey, learned in a turn-based game in which his opponent, I think, was using computer assistance...
What can I say? It shouldn't be hard at all to "find something better" -- the Jerome Gambit makes the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit lookgood.
I will continue to research Alonzo Wheeler Jerome's (American Civil War veteran, officer in U.S.C.T., hemp farmer and inventer) opening. Any games you have uncovered or played -- I'd love to see them.
I've played the Jerome Gambit about 70 times so far here at chess.com and other sites with great success.  I first played the gambit in 2001 and still play it in 2011.  It's great for blitz chess as long as you know all the traps and the other guy doesn't have time to think and find the exact way out of this sacrifice.  Perrypawnpusher (Rick Kennedy) offers a database of thousands of Jerome Gambits (and adding Blackburne Shilling Gambits and reversed BSGs) which I have studied.  Only a few players have found the right continuation to bust this line and for Black to win, so it is good odds that you can draw or most likely win if you know the trappy lines.  And I am a guy who studies and plays for trappy lines and short games.  This has been one of my favorite gambits for the past year.  GM Larry Christiansen almost plays this gambit (he sacs the Bishop on c4 at f7) in many of his blitz games and doesn't have a problem winning.  But, then again, he is a grandmaster.

Good game by Shinkman, against Alonzo Wheeler Jerome himself -- handing White his head, only 3 months after the Jerome Gambit made its published debut! Note the value of a well-timed ...Qf6, as I mentioned in my response to PrawnEatsPrawn, above.
I guess the moral is:Don't play the Jerome Gambit -- or, if youdo, don't play it incorrespondence chess...
really really bad and unsound gambit
Noted.
No illusions here. Not too long agoChess Life for Kidsran my two-part article on "The Worst Chess Opening Ever" about the Jerome Gambit.
Although perhaps you might like the Jerome-style treatment of the Blackburne Shilling Gambit:1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nd4!? 4.Bxf7+!?. GM Lev Alburt's "Back to Basics" column in the March 2011 issue ofChess Lifefeatured a game of mine, with White, in this line.

## Kings Gambit
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Kings-Gambit)
TheKing's Gambitis an age-old aggressive opening that Romantic chess players revered. Largely employed by top players for more than 300 years, this opening leads to open games that are exciting and, in most cases, decisive.
With the rise of engines and computer analysis, top players have virtually abandoned the King's Gambit in high-stakes games because of its risky nature. However, tactical players who enjoy sharp games can still employ this opening to play for a fabulous (and usually sacrificial) attack to win the game in style.
TheKing's Gambithappens after1.e4 e5 2.f4and it's the fourth most popular move after Black plays 1...e5. White's idea is to gambit a pawn to build a strong center after diverting Black's e5-pawn to f4. If Black accepts the pawn sacrifice, White has two main plans: attack the weak f7-square or play d2-d4 and develop their pieces to active squares.

After the game enters the King's Gambit with2.f4, Black can accept or decline the pawn sacrifice. Below are the four main lines, two of them taking the pawn and the other two ignoring it.
The most popular way to play is to accept the gambit with2...exf4. After that, White's main move is to play3.Nf3, entering theKing's Knight's Gambitline. White stops Black from playing Qh4 with check and starts developing the kingside. Usually, White will try to quickly castle and apply pressure on the f7-square using the light-squared bishop, knight, and the open f-file.
Another line after Black accepts the pawn is to play4.Bc4and enter theBishop's Gambit, a variation preferred by GMBobby Fischer. This move allows Black to play Qh4+, forcing the white king to f1. White will accept that to later play Nf3, gaining a tempo on the black queen. From there, White usually tries to build a strong center and go on the offensive.
TheFalkbeer Countergambitis the most popular way to decline the King's Gambit. The game enters this line after1.e4 e5 2.f4 d5. Black strikes at the center immediately instead of taking White's wing pawn.
TheKing's Gambit Declined: Classical Variationoccurs after1.e4 e5 2.f4 Bc5, with Black developing the dark-squared bishop to a dangerous diagonal. With this line, Black refuses to play the crazy games that would unfold after accepting the gambit. The bishop on c5 does a good job preventing the white king from castling kingside, keeping the it exposed.
One of the disadvantages of the King's Gambit is that Black has many ways of playing against it. Any player who knows theory can get good positions with Black by "defusing" the gambit whether they decide to accept or decline it.
If you want to respond to White's aggressive opening by escalating the aggression, you can opt for theFalkbeer Countergambit. As stated above, it arises after1.e4 e5 2.f4 d5. Black's idea is to open up the center and explore the weakness White created around their king after the f2-f4 push.
This variation became famous after Fischer published an article titled "A Bust to the King's Gambit." If you want to accept the gambit and White chooses to develop the g1-knight, this is a great way to get a good position. The variation goes1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Nf3 d6, and Black will usually play the g7-g5 push to keep the f4-pawn or build pressure on the kingside. With 381 games in our database, White wins 35%, draws 15%, and Black wins 50%.
After accepting the gambit, White can develop the light-squared bishop before the knight. For this line, theCozio Variationscores well. After1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Bc4 Qh4+ 4.Kf1 d6, White can no longer castle. From this position, White wins 28% of the games, draws 21%, and Black wins 52%.

The oldest record of the King's Gambit comes from a 1560 game betweenRuy Lopez de Seguraand Giovani Leonardo Da Cutri. The opening never fell out of fashion among European players, and in the early 1600s, the prominentGioachino Grecoadopted the opening and developed a significant theory on it.
In the 1800s, the opening became extremely popular, with many of the best players of their time playing it. Players likeAlexander McDonnell,Howard Staunton,Paul Morphy,Adolf Anderssen, and many others had the King's Gambit as an integral part of their arsenal.
The King's Gambit began losing its popularity around the beginning of the 1900s. At that time, players' knowledge of positional and defensive concepts was significantly higher than in the previous centuries, making it harder for White to gain a significant advantage from the opening.
By the middle of the 20th century, few of the elite players still relied on the King's Gambit in high-stakes games. In 1961, Fischer wrote the famous article "A Bust to the King's Gambit," giving even more traction to the "movement" against the opening.
Nowadays, the King's Gambit is rare in high-level games. However, players like GMsGarry Kasparov,Ian Nepomniachtchi, andMagnus Carlsenhave played this aggressive opening in shorter time controls.
The Romantic Era of chess has plenty of examples of games with the King's Gambit. You can also find examples of this opening in more recent games from strong players like GMDavid Bronsteinand even world champions like GMsBoris Spasskyand Fischer. Below you can see two famous games with the King's Gambit:
Anderssen vs. Lionel Kieseritzky - The Immortal Game
Spassky vs. Bronstein

TheKing's Gambitis achess openingthat begins with the moves:
White offers apawnto divert the black e-pawn. If Black accepts thegambit, White may play d4 and Bxf4, regaining the gambit pawn withcentraldomination, or direct their forces against the weak square f7 with moves such as Nf3, Bc4, 0-0, and g3. A downside to the King's Gambit is that it weakens White's king's position, exposing it to the latent threat of ...Qh4+ (or...Be7–h4+), which may force White to give upcastlingrights.
The King's Gambit is one of the oldest documented openings, appearing in one of the earliest chess books,Luis Ramírez de Lucena'sRepetición de Amores y Arte de Ajedrez(1497).[1]It was examined by the 17th-century Italian chess playerGiulio Cesare Polerio.[2]The King's Gambit was one of the most popular openings until the late 19th century, when improvements in defensive technique led to its decline in popularity. It is infrequently seen atmasterlevel today, as Black has several methods to obtainequality, but is still popular at amateur level.
The King's Gambit was one of the most popular openings for over 300 years, and has been played by many of the strongest players in many of the greatestbrilliancies, including theImmortal Game. Nevertheless, players have held widely divergent views on it.François-André Danican Philidor(1726–1795), the greatest player andtheoristof his day, wrote that the King's Gambit should end in adrawwithbest playby both sides, stating that "a gambit equally well attacked and defended is never a decisive [game], either on one side or the other."[3]Writing over 150 years later,Siegbert Tarrasch, one of the world's strongest players in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, pronounced the opening "a decisive mistake" and wrote that "it is almost madness to play the King's Gambit."[4]Similarly, futureworld championBobby Fischerwrote a famous article, "A Bust to the King's Gambit", in which he stated, "In my opinion the King's Gambit is busted. It loses by force" and offered hisFischer Defense(3...d6) as a refutation.[5][6]FMGraham Burgess, in his bookThe Mammoth Book of Chess, noted the discrepancy between the King's Gambit andWilhelm Steinitz's accumulation theory. Steinitz had argued that an attack is only justified when a player has an advantage, and an advantage is only obtainable after the opponent makes a mistake. Since 1...e5 does not look like a blunder, White should therefore not be launching an attack.[7]
While the King's Gambit Accepted was a staple of Romantic era chess, the opening began to decline with the development of opening theory and improvements in defensive technique in the late 19th century. By the 1920s, 1.e4 openings declined in popularity with the rise of thehypermodernschool, with many players switching to 1.d4 and 1.c4 openings andpositional play. After World War II, 1.e4 openings became more popular again, withDavid Bronsteinbeing the firstgrandmasterin decades to use the King's Gambit in serious play. He inspiredBoris Spasskyto also take up the King's Gambit, although Spassky was not willing to risk using the opening in any of his World Championship matches. Spassky did beat many strong players with it, however, including Bobby Fischer,[8]Zsuzsa Polgar,[9]and a famousbrilliancyagainst Bronstein himself.[10]
In 2012, anApril Fools' Dayprank byChessbasein association withVasik Rajlich—inventor of chess engineRybka—claimed to have proven to a 99.99999999% certainty that the King's Gambit is at best a draw for White, but only after 3.Be2.[11][12]Revealing the prank, Rajlich admitted that current computer technology is nowhere near solving such a task.[13]
The King's Gambit is rare in modern high-level play.[14]The main reason is that it is hard to gain an opening advantage with White against strong opponents, with GMMatthew Sadleronce joking that the dream of every King's Gambit player is a "worse but holdable ending".[15]A handful of grandmasters have continued to use it, includingJoseph Gallagher,Hikaru Nakamura,Baskaran Adhiban,Nigel Short, andAlexei Fedorov, albeit never as a main weapon.
Although Black usually accepts the gambit pawn, two methods of declining the gambit—theClassical Defense(2...Bc5) and theFalkbeer Countergambit(2...d5)—are also popular. After2...exf4, the two main continuations for White are 3.Nf3 (King's Knight's Gambit) and 3.Bc4 (Bishop's Gambit).
This is the most popular move. It develops theknightand prevents 3...Qh4+. Black's two main approaches are to attempt to hold on to the pawn with ...g5, or to return the pawn in order to facilitatedevelopment.
The Classical Variation arises after 3.Nf3 g5. Black defends the f4-pawn, and threatens to kick the f3-knight with ...g4, or else to consolidate with ...Bg7 and ...h6. The main continuations traditionally have been 4.h4 and 4.Bc4. More recently, 4.Nc3 (the Quaade Gambit or Quaade Attack)[16]has been recommended by Scottish grandmaster (GM)John Shawas a less explored alternative to 4.h4 and superior to 4.Bc4.[17]
With 4.h4 White practically forces 4...g4, thereby undermining any attempt by Black to set up a stable pawn chain with ...h6 and ...Bg7.
TheKieseritzky Gambit, 4.h4 g4 5.Ne5, is considered by modern writers such as Shaw and Gallagher to be the main line after 3...g5. It was popularized byLionel Kieseritzkyin the 1840s and used successfully byWilhelm Steinitz.Boris Spasskyused it to beatBobby Fischerin a famous game atMar del Platain 1960.[18]The main line of the Kieseritzky Gambit is considered to be 5...Nf6 6.Bc4 d5 7.exd5 Bd6 8.d4 with an unclear position. The Long Whip Variation, 5...h5?! 6.Bc4 Rh7 (or 6...Nh6) is considered old-fashioned and risky, as Black loses a lot of time attempting to hold on to the pawn.
4.h4 g4 5.Ng5 is theAllgaierGambit,[19]intending 5...h6 6.Nxf7. This knight sacrifice is considered unsound.[20]
The extremelysharpMuzio Gambit[21]arises after 4.Bc4 g4 5.0-0 gxf3 6.Qxf3, where White has sacrificed a knight but has three pieces bearing down on f7.[22]Such wild play is rare in modern chess, but Black must defend accurately. Perhaps the sharpest continuation is the Double Muzio after 6...Qf6 7.e5 Qxe5 8.Bxf7+!?, leaving White two pieces down in eight moves, but with a position that some masters consider to be equal.[23][24]In practice White's play seems to be easier, especially when the opponent is surprised by such daring tactics.
Similar lines are theGhulam KassimGambit, 4.Bc4 g4 5.d4, and theMcDonnell Gambit, 4.Bc4 g4 5.Nc3. These are generally considered inferior to the Muzio, which has the advantage of reinforcing White's attack along the f-file. Also inferior is theLolliGambit 4.Bc4 g4 5.Bxf7+?!, which leaves White with insufficientcompensationfor the piece after 5...Kxf7 6.Ne5+ Ke8 7.Qxg4 Nf6 8.Qxf4 d6.
TheSalvioGambit, 4.Bc4 g4 5.Ne5 Qh4+ 6.Kf1, is considered better for Black due to the insecurity of White's king. Black may play safely with 6...Nh6 (Silberschmidt Variation), or counter-sacrifice with 6...f3 (CochraneGambit) or 6...Nc6 (Viennese Variation).
A safer alternative to 4...g4 is 4...Bg7,[23]which usually leads to the Hanstein Gambit after 5.d4 d6 6.0-0 h6 or the Philidor Gambit after 5.h4 h6 6.d4 d6 (other move orders are possible in both cases).
The Quaade Gambit (3.Nf3 g5 4.Nc3) is named after a Danish amateur who discussed it in correspondence with theDeutsche Schachzeitungin the 1880s.[25]The move has received renewed attention following its recommendation by John Shaw in his 2013 book on the King's Gambit. A well-known trap here is 4...g4 5.Ne5 Qh4+ 6.g3 fxg3 7.Qxg4 g2+?(7...Qxg4 8.Nxg4 d5 is about equal) 8.Qxh4 gxh1=Q 9.Qh5!and White is close to winning. (Black's best defense is considered 9...Nh6 10.d4 d6 11.Bxh6 dxe5 12.Qxe5+ Be6 13.Qxh8 Nd7 14.Bxf8 0-0-0 and White will emerge a clear pawn ahead.) Instead, 4...Bg7 has been recommended. 4...d6 and 4...h6 transpose to Fischer's Defense and Becker's Defense, respectively. Also possible is 4...Nc6, recommended byKonstantin Sakaev.[26][27]
After 4...Bg7 5.d4 g4,Simon Williamsadvocates 6.Bxf4 gxf3 in his DVD andChess.comvideo series.[28]White is down a knight, but has a strong attack. The Quaade Gambit has recently been advocated byDaniel Kingin his PowerPlay series for Chessbase.
This is likely to lead to similar positions to the Quaade Gambit; however, 4...g4 5.Ne5 Qh4+ 6.g3 fxg3 7.Qxg4 g2+!? (7...Qxg4=) is now viable due to the threat against the pawn on e4. After 8.Qxh4 gxh1=Q Shaw recommends 9.Nc3 for White, with a complicated position.[29]
TheBeckerDefense (3.Nf3 h6), has the idea of creating apawn chainon h6, g5, f4 to defend the f4 pawn while avoiding the Kieseritzky Gambit, so Black will not be forced to play ...g4 when White plays to undermine the chain with h4. White has the option of 4.b3, although the main line continues with 4.d4 g5 (ECOC37) and usually transposes to lines of the Classical Variation after 5.Bc4 Bg7 6.0-0 (ECOC38).
The rarely seen Bonch-Osmolovsky Defense[30](3.Nf3 Ne7) aims to defend the f4-pawn with ...Ng6, a relatively safe square for the knight compared to the Schallopp Defense. It was played byMark Bluvshteinto defeat former world title finalistNigel ShortatMontreal2007,[31]even though it has never been highly regarded by theory.
TheCunninghamDefense (3.Nf3 Be7) threatens a check on h4 that can permanently prevent White from castling; furthermore, if White does not immediately develop the king's bishop, Ke2 would be forced, which hems the bishop in. A sample line is 4.Nc3 Bh4+ 5.Ke2 d5 6.Nxd5 Nf6 7.Nxf6+ Qxf6 8.d4 Bg4 9.Qd2 (diagram). White has strong central control with pawns on d4 and e4, while Black is relying on the white king's discomfort to compensate.
To avoid having to play Ke2, 4.Bc4 is White's most popular response.[32]Black can play 4...Bh4+ anyway, forcing 5.Kf1 (or else the wildBertinGambit or Three Pawns' Gambit, 5.g3 fxg3 6.0-0 gxh2+ 7.Kh1, played in the nineteenth century). In modern practice, it is more common for Black to simply develop instead with 4...Nf6 5.e5 Ng4, known as the Modern Cunningham. An under-explored but seemingly playable line here is 5...Ne4!?, theEuweVariation, which has a number of trappy ideas.
TheSchalloppDefense (3.Nf3 Nf6) is usually played with the intention of holding on to the pawn after 4.e5 Nh5. While it is not Black's most popular option, it attracted some attention in 2020 whenDing Lirenused it to beat Magnus Carlsen in the onlineMagnus Carlsen Invitationaltournament. The undefended knight on h5 means Black must be careful: for example 4.e5 Nh5 5.d4 d6 6.Qe2 Be7? (correct is 6...d5!=) 7.exd6 Qxd6 8.Qb5+ wins the h5-knight.[33]
The Modern Defense, orAbbaziaDefense,[34](3.Nf3 d5) has much the same idea as the Falkbeer Countergambit, and can in fact be reached via transposition, i.e. 2...d5 3.exd5 exf4 4.Nf3. Black concentrates on gaining piece play and fighting for theinitiativerather than keeping the extra pawn. It has been recommended by several publications as an easy way to equalize, although White's extra central pawn and piece activity gives a slight advantage. If White captures (4.exd5) then Black may play 4...Nf6 or recapture with 4...Qxd5, at which point it becomes theScandinavianVariation ofKGA. This variation was considered most critical in the past, but recent trends seem to indicate a slight advantage for White.
"The refutation of any gambit begins with accepting it. In my opinion the King's Gambit is busted. It loses by force." — R. Fischer, "A Bust to the King's Gambit"
The Fischer Defense (3.Nf3 d6), although previously known, was advocated byBobby Fischerafter he was defeated byBoris Spasskyin a Kieseritzky Gambit at the 1960Mar del Plata tournament. Fischer then decided to refute the King's Gambit, and the next year theAmerican Chess Quarterlypublished Fischer's analysis of 3...d6, which he called "a high-class waiting move".[5][6]
The point is that after 4.d4 g5 5.h4 g4 White cannot continue with 6.Ne5 as in the Kieseritzky Gambit, 6.Ng5 is unsound because of 6...f6!trapping the knight, and 6.Nfd2 blocks the bishop on c1. This leaves the move 6.Ng1 as the only option, when after six moves neither side has developed a piece. The resulting slightly odd position (diagram) offers White good attacking chances. A typical continuation is 6.Ng1 Bh6 7.Ne2 Qf6 8.Nbc3 c6 9.g3 f3 10.Nf4 Qe7 with an unclear position (Korchnoi/Zak).
The main alternative to 4.d4 is 4.Bc4. Play usually continues 4...h6 5.d4 g5 6.0-0 Bg7, transposing into the Hanstein Gambit, which can also be reached via 3...g5 or 3...h6.
The MacLeod Defense, 3...Nc6, is named afterNicholas MacLeod.Joe Gallagherwrites that 3.Nf3 Nc6 "has never really caught on, probably because it does nothing to address Black's immediate problems." Like Fischer's Defense, it is awaiting move.[35]An obvious drawback is that the knight on c6 may prove a target for the d-pawn later in the opening.
An invention of the Hungarian/English player, János Wagenbach.John Shawwrites: "If given the time, Black intends to seal up the kingside with ...h4 followed by ...g5, securing the extra pawn on f4 without allowing an undermining h2–h4. The drawback is of course the amount of time required".[36]
Of the alternatives to 3.Nf3, the most important is the Bishop's Gambit, 3.Bc4. White allows 3...Qh4+ 4.Kf1, losing the right to castle, but this loses time for Black after the inevitable Nf3 and White will develop rapidly. White also has the option of delaying Nf3, however, and can instead play g3!?, after which the game becomes quite sharp, with White having the option of Qf3 with an attack on f7, or Kg2 threatening hxg3. This idea is advocated, among others, by GMSimon Williams.[37]
Korchnoi and Zak recommend as best for Black 3...Nf6 4.Nc3 c6, or the alternative move order 3...c6 4.Nc3 Nf6. After 5.Bb3 d5 6.exd5 cxd5 7.d4 Bd6 8.Nge2 0-0 9.0-0 g5 10.Nxd5 Nc6, Black was somewhat better in Spielmann–Bogoljubow, Märisch Ostrau 1923.[38]
Black's other main option is 3...d5, returning the pawn immediately. Play might continue 3...d5 4.Bxd5 Nf6 5.Nc3 Bb4 6.Nf3 Bxc3 7.dxc3 c6 8.Bc4 Qxd1+ 9.Kxd1 0-0 10.Bxf4 Nxe4 with an equal position (Bilguer Handbuch, Korchnoi/Zak).
3...Nc6!?, Maurian Defense, is relatively untested, but if White plays 4.Nf3 Black can transpose into the Hanstein Gambit after 4...g5 5.d4 Bg7 6.c3 d6 7.0-0 h6 (Neil McDonald, 1998). John Shaw wrote that 3...Nc6 is a "refutation" of the Bishop's Gambit, as he says that Black is better in all variations.
Steinitz's 3...Ne7 and thecountergambit3...f5 (best met by 4.Qe2!) are generally considered inferior.
Other 3rd moves for White are rarely played. Some of these are:
Black can decline the offered pawn, or offer acountergambit.
The Falkbeer Countergambit is named after the 19th-centuryAustrianmasterErnst Falkbeer. It runs 1.e4 e5 2.f4 d5 3.exd5 e4, in which Blacksacrificesa pawn in return for quick and easy development. It was once considered good for Black and scored well, but White obtains some advantage with the response 4.d3!, and the line fell out of favor after the 1930s.
A more modern interpretation of the Falkbeer is 2...d5 3.exd5 c6!?, as advocated byAron Nimzowitsch. Black is not concerned about pawns and aims for earlypieceactivity. White has a better pawn structure and prospects of a betterendgame. The main line continues 4.Nc3 exf4 5.Nf3 Bd6 6.d4 Ne7 7.dxc6 Nbxc6, giving positions analogous to the Modern Variation of the gambit accepted.
A common way to decline the gambit is with 2...Bc5, the "classical"KGD. The bishop prevents White fromcastlingand is such a nuisance that White often expends twotempito eliminate it by means of Nc3–a4, to exchange on c5 or b6, after which White may castle without worry. It also contains an opening trap for novices: if White continues with 3.fxe5??Black continues 3...Qh4+, in which either therookis lost (4.g3 Qxe4+,forkingthe rook andking) or White ischeckmated(4.Ke2 Qxe4#). This line often comes about bytranspositionfrom lines of theVienna GameorBishop's Opening, when White plays f2–f4 before Nf3.
One rarely seen line is the Rotlewi Countergambit:[42]3.Nf3 d6 4.b4!?. The idea of the gambit is similar to that seen in theEvans Gambitof theItalian Game. White sacrifices a pawn to try and build a strong center with 4...Bxb4 5.c3 Bc5 (or 5...Ba5) 6.fxe5 dxe5 7.d4. This line is considered slightly dubious, however.
Other options in the KGD are possible, though unusual, such as the Adelaide Countergambit 2...Nc6 3.Nf3 f5, advocated byTony Miles; 2...d6, which is the way the King’s Gambit was declined the first known time it was played,[43]when after 3.Nf3, best is 3...exf4 transposing to theFischer Defense(though 2...d6 invites White to play 3.d4 instead); and 2...Nf6 3.fxe5 Nxe4 4.Nf3 Ng5! 5.d4 Nxf3+ 6.Qxf3 Qh4+ 7.Qf2 Qxf2+ 8.Kxf2 with a small endgame advantage, as played in the 1968 game betweenBobby FischerandBob WadeinVinkovci.[44]The greedy 2...Qf6 (known as theNordwaldeVariation), intending 3...Qxf4, is considered dubious. Also dubious are theKeeneDefense: 2...Qh4+ 3.g3 Qe7 and theMafiaDefense: 1.e4 e5 2.f4 c5.[45]
2...f5?!is among the oldest countergambits in KGD, known from a game published in 1625 byGioachino Greco.[46]Vincenz Hrubyalso played it againstMikhail Chigorinin 1882.[47]It is nonetheless considered dubious because 3.exf5 with the threat of Qh5+ gives White a good game. The variation is sometimes named the Pantelidakis Countergambit because GMLarry Evansanswered a question from Peter Pantelidakis of Chicago about it in one of his columns inChess Life and Review.
In several lines of theVienna GameWhite offers a sort of delayed King's Gambit. In theVienna Gambit(1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.f4), Black should reply 3...d5, since 3....exf4?!4.e5 forces the knight to retreat. 1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.f4 exf4 may lead to theHamppe–Muzio Gambitafter 4.Nf3 g5 5.Bc4 g4 6.0-0 gxf3 7.Qxf3, or to theSteinitz Gambitafter 4.d4 Qh4+ 5.Ke2. Both of these lines may be reached via the King's Gambit proper, but the Vienna move order is more common.
White may also offer the gambit in theBishop's Opening, e.g. 1.e4 e5 2.Bc4 Nc6 3.f4, though this is uncommon.
TheEncyclopaedia of Chess Openingshas ten codes for the King's Gambit, C30 through C39.

## Kings Indian Attack
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Kings-Indian-Attack)
The fastest way to fianchetto the king's bishop and castle is the King's Indian Attack (KIA), the reverse of the King's Indian Defense. White just plays Nf3, g3, Bg2, and 0-0, before seeing how to proceed.
The KIA also refers to a plethora of systems for White involving pawns on d3, g3, and e4; knights on d2 and f3; a kingside fianchetto and kingside castling. This KIA setup can be used after 1.e4  against the Sicilian Defense, French Defense, Caro-Kann Defense, and many other popular openings for Black. White often plays for a kingside attack with Black trying to win on the queenside.
The King's Indian Attack, when referring to a specific opening, generally starts with either1.Nf3 d5 2.g3or 1.Nf3Nf6 2.g3.
A kingside fianchetto with Nf3 is an idea in several other openings as well, most notably the French Defense variation 1.e4 e6 2.d3, but also in the Sicilian, Caro-Kann, and others.
There are many variations of the KIA, but the main question regardless is Black's decision with the c-pawn: Play ...c6 to blunt the fianchettoed bishop's diagonal, or play ...c5 to gain extra queenside space? This choice also determines where Black's b8-knight will go: behind the c-pawn on c6 or to d7.
Oftentimes Black will play not only ...c5 but ...b5 and ...a5 and try to win on the queenside before White can breakt hrough on the kingside, as in the following possible move order.
Some specific early variations are below.
Whichever order Black plays the first two moves ...Nf6 and ...d5, it's the Yugoslav Variation. It's the most common way to meet Nf3 and g3 from White, both developing and beginning to claim the central space that White has foregone.
The Keres Variation, named for GMPaul Keres, is mainly a move order subtlety where Black develops the c8-bishop as quickly as possible, to be followed up with ...Nd7 and ...c6.
Black can also immediately announce the intention to claim as much space as possible with ...c5 on move two. It essentially creates a reverse King's Indian Defense and play often continues in that vein with something like3.Bg2 Nc6 4.O-O e5or4...Nf6.
Like several hypermodern openings, the King's Indian Attack was first known to be played by Bonnerjee Mohishunder in his games with John Cochrane in Calcutta (Kolkata), India in the 1850s, but did not become more widely popular until the 1920s.
The heyday of the KIA was the 1960s when GMsPal BenkoandBobby Fischerwon regularly with it, as IMJeremy Silmandiscusseshere. Although now less popular at the GM level, it can be used when someone desperately needs a win as White, and remains a good option for more casual players.
==========
The Polish Opening, also known as the Sokolsky or the Orangutan, is the opening 1.b4 by White. Although only the ninth-most popular opening move, it's a respectable option with some devoted followers. Instead of playing in the center, White fights for an advantage on the queenside.
The Polish is very distinctive and once 1.b4 is played, a game is in the Polish Opening with little chance at transposing into something else.
Black has several viable options against the Polish. Here are the most popular.
Black's most common response is 1...e5, immediately attacking the b-pawn. Often a trade follows with 2.Bb2 Bxb4 3.Bxe5. Although this trade's a central Black pawn for a wing White pawn, Black scores very well. Black does less well defending the e-pawn with either 2...d6 or 2...f6 but both are playable.
Black's next two most popular moves are 1...d5 and 1...Nf6 and they often transpose into the same line, the Schiffler-Sokolsky. Black has more central space while White gains further queenside space by pushing the b-pawn again. The most common move order is given below.

The idea behind this move, the Outflank Variation, is to attack the b-pawn with 2...Qb6.
The two players most associated with 1.b4 are Polish GMSavielly Tartakower(1887-1956) and Soviet IM Alexey Sokolsky (1908-1969), hence the common names for the opening: the Polish (more common in the West) and the Sokolsky (more so in Russian sources). The third name, the Orangutan, is also thanks to Tartakower. During the 1924 New York tournament he visited the Bronx Zoo and something inspired him to play the move and name it for that primate.
It was an obscure 19th-century British player, however, who first played 1.b4: Arthur Skipworth in 1868, a game Skipworth won. Maybe we don't call it the Skipworth Opening because that makes it sound like it's worth skipping.
Although rare, the Polish Opening isn't bad and it can lead to unique positions that are interesting to play.

TheKing's Indian Attack(orKIA) is achess openingsystemwhere White adopts the setup more commonly seen being played by Black in theKing's Indian Defence. The King's Indian Attack is characterised by the following moves: the central pawns are developed to e4 and d3, the knights are developed to d2 and f3, theking's bishopisfianchettoedat g2 following the g-pawn's move to g3, and White castles kingside.
This pattern can either be achieved via a 1.e4move order(typically against either theFrench Defenceor aSicilian Defencewith a subsequent ...e6) or as a universal system starting with 1.Nf3.
The use of the King's Indian Attack atgrandmasterlevel was originally an offshoot from the widespread use of theKing's Indian Defencein the 1950s. As grandmasters began to appreciate the advantages of playing the King's Indian Defence as Black, the use of the same system as White, with an extra move in hand, inevitably became attractive.
Prominent players who have employed the King's Indian Attack includeBobby Fischer(mostly in his early career),Mikhail Botvinnik,Vasily Smyslov,Tigran Petrosian,Leonid Stein,Rafael Vaganian,Ljubomir Ljubojevic,Gregory Kaidanov,Igor Glek,Alexander Morozevich,Victor Bologan, andLevon Aronian. The use of the KIA was also advocated by the prominent chess trainer IMMark Dvoretsky,[1]who also employed the system in his own games.
Today the King's Indian Attack is relatively uncommon at grandmaster level. The most frequent high-level practitioner is Egyptian grandmasterBassem Amin. The KIA is popular at the club level, however, because of its system-like elements, repeatablemiddlegameplans, and the ability to launch a kingside attack from a stable position.
In the King's Indian Attack, White uses the same setup adopted by Black in theKing's Indian Defence. Due to White's extratempo, however, the nature of the subsequent play is often different from that of a typical King's Indian Defence. The King's Indian Attack is most frequently employed against Black setups including an early ...e6, and in these situations Black is effectively a move down in a theoretically unimportant line of the King's Indian Defence. For example, after 1.e4 e6 2.d3 d5 3.Nd2 c5 4.Ngf3 Nf6 5.g3 Nc6 6.Bg2 Be7 7.0-0 0-0 8.Re1 (see diagram) Black is playing the White side of a very tame line of the King's Indian Defence where thequeen's bishopon c8 is trapped behind thepawn chain. If Black were to attempt to resolve this situation by playing a subsequent e6-e5 they would then find themselvestwomoves down in a standard mainline position from the King's Indian Defence. This illustrates the central dilemma faced by Black in standard Kings Indian Attack lines.
The KIA is aclosed, strategic opening that presents its practitioner with common themes and tactics and a comfortable middlegame against various defences. White's most common plan involves the central pawn push e4–e5, leading to a central bind,kingsidespace, and practical  attacking chances against the kingside-castledblack king. White's strategy differs from standardFrench Defencelines because the e5-pawn will be defended by pieces (Nf3, Re1, Bf4, and possibly Qe2) rather than by pawns, thus avoiding the pawn weakness on d4 which is Black's usual target in the French.
The King's Indian Attack most frequently arises against the French Defence using the move order 1.e4 e6 2.d3 d5 3.Nbd2 (to avoid an exchange of queens after 3...dxe4) 3...c5. Identical lines can arise via aSicilian Defencemove order, typically via 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d3 and a subsequent Nbd2. If Black plays a Sicilian variation with 2...d6 or 2...Nc6, White can still continue with the King's Indian Attack setup, but in these cases it would be considered less effective (Black will either have a pawn on d6, meaning that the characteristic pawn push e4–e5 will not create a bind, or a pawn on e5, preventing e4-e5 altogether).
After 1.e4 e6 2.d3 d5 3.Nbd2 c5, the game might typically proceed as follows: 4.Ngf3 Nf6 5.g3 Nc6 6.Bg2 Be7 7.0-0 0-0 8.Re1 (see diagram in previous section). White will now look to play e4–e5, cramping Black, and then proceed with moves such as Nf1, Bf4, Qe2, h4, N1h2 (or Ne3), h5, g4 (or Ng4) with a kingside attack. Note that the position after 8.Re1 could also have been obtained via a 1.Nf3 move order (e.g. 1.Nf3 d5 2.g3 Nf6 3.Bg2 c5 4.0-0 Nc6 5.d3 e6 etc.).
The Kings Indian Attack setup is also sometimes employed against theCaro–Kann Defence, e.g. 1.e4 c6 2.d3 d5 3.Nbd2 e5 4.Ngf3 Bd6 5.g3 etc. Some practitioners at club level, determined to use the KIA as a system, may even use the setup after 1.e4 e5 (giving a reversedPirc Defence), although this cannot be regarded as a genuine attempt to secure an advantage from the opening.
When employed via a 1.Nf3 move order, play sometimes develops along the lines of the Franco-Sicilian type structures considered above. Alternatively, Black can look to develop the c8-bishop outside of the pawn chain, either to Bg4 (the Keres System, e.g. 1.Nf3 d5 2.g3 Nf6 3.Bg2 c6 4.0-0 Bg4) or to Bf5 (giving a reversedLondon System).
Black can also develop along the lines typically adopted by White in the King's Indian Defence: e.g. 1.Nf3 d5 2.g3 c5 3.Bg2 Nc6 4.0-0 e5 5.d3 Nf6. This line is referred to as the Reversed King's Indian.

## Kings Indian Defense
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Kings-Indian-Defense)
The King's Indian Defense is ahypermodernaggressive opening for Black as a response for 1.d4. Following hypermodern principles, Black allows White to build a strong pawn center to later counter-attack it. A sharp opening, the King's Indian is not be the best choice for beginners. However, a number of strong grandmasters likeBobby FischerandGarry Kasparovconsistently employed this opening when fighting for a win with the black pieces.
TheKing's Indian Defensearises after the moves1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6. Like in other hypermodern openings, Black doesn't try to control the center with pawns. Instead, the idea is to let White build a strong pawn center and then counter-attack it using pieces and pawns.
The King's Indian leads to unbalanced positions where Black tries to fight for an advantage instead of equality. For this reason, it's also a risky opening which usually leads to White having an edge when playing accurately. However, it's also more difficult for White to play for a draw, which tends to lead to more decisive games.
The theory on the King's Indian is extensive, with many different lines that are popular among top players.
The main line of the King's Indian sees White building a strong pawn center and Black playing the thematic central pawn break with 6...e5. Black will usually play for checkmate with a kingside attack, while White will likely counter-attack the queenside.
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.Nf3 O-O 6.Be2 e5 7.O-O Nc6

The widely popular Samisch variation starts after White plays 5.f3. With this move, White lends support to the e4-pawn and prevents the black f6-knight from jumping to g4. The game usually develops into an all-out war, with players castling to opposite sides of the board. White can also try to squeeze Black slowly with their space advantage.
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.f3
Another popular variation is the Averbakh, where White develops the dark-squared bishop to g5. This move discourages the typical King's Indian e7-e5 pawn break.
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Be2 O-O 6. Bg5
The Petrosian variation is another way to face the King's Indian. White plays the early 7.d5, closing down the center and slowing down the game—something not all King's Indian players are comfortable with. Black will usually maneuver to attack the kingside, with White going for the queenside.
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.Nf3 O-O 6.Be2 e5 7.d5
The Four Pawns Attack was considered one of the best responses of the King's Indian for years. White accepts Black's challenge and takes the whole center with pawns on c4, d4, e4, and f4. White can then go for a sharp game or try to create a bind. However, the current theory states that White's immense pawn center is slightly flimsy and can be a liability.
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f4
White's score is usually favorable against the King's Indian Defense. Black's attempt to create an unbalanced position to fight for the advantage can backfire, and statistics show that the well-prepared White player will usually win or draw the game. Below are the variations that have been played numerous times by masters and score well against the King's Indian:
If you study the main line of the King's Indian for White, you're likely to enjoy considerable success against it. Of the more than 54,000 games in our masters database following the main line, White wins 42%, draws 30%, and loses merely 28%. As stated above, the main line goes1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.Nf3 O-O 6.Be2.
If you'd like to try to surprise your opponent with a sideline, you might want to consider the Makogonov Variation. This variation is gaining popularity among super grandmasters as a way of fighting the King's Indian. With close to 5,000 games in our masters database, White won 51% of the games, drew 24%, and lost only 25%.
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.h3.
With 5.h3, White wants to make the g2-g4 push to stop Black's thematic plan of playing f7-f5. The h3-pawn also stops Black from playing Ng4, allowing White to develop their dark-squared bishop to d3 safely.
The King's Indian Defense has been around for centuries, but many masters considered it a suspicious opening since it gave up control of the center. The opening started gaining traction after the rise of hypermodernism in chess and became widely accepted after strong players like GMDavid Bronsteinemployed it successfully.
Many strong grandmasters have adopted this opening, including former world champions GMMikhail Taland Kasparov. The King's Indian is still largely used in tournaments, with players such as GMsTeimour RadjabovandHikaru Nakamurachoosing it as one of their main weapons with Black.
If you want to improve your understanding of the King's Indian, you should study the games of players like Bronstein, Tal, Kasparov, and GM Bobby Fischer. Below are some famous games with this opening:
GM Viktor Korchnoi vs. Fischer
GM Anatoly Karpov vs. Kasparov

TheKing's Indian Defence(orKID) is a commonchess opening. It is defined by the following  moves:
Black intends to follow up with 3...Bg7 and 4...d6 (theGrünfeld Defencearises when Black plays 3...d5 instead and is considered a separate opening). White's major third move options are 3.Nc3, 3.Nf3 or 3.g3, with both the King's Indian and Grünfeld playable against these moves. TheEncyclopaedia of Chess Openingsclassifies the King's Indian Defence under the codes E60 through E99.
The King's Indian is ahypermodernopening, where Black deliberately allows White control of thecentrewith pawns, with the view to subsequently challenge it. In the most critical lines of the King's Indian, White erects an imposing pawn centre with Nc3 followed by e4. Black stakes out their own claim to the centre with theBenoni-style ...c5, or ...e5. If White resolves the central pawn tension with d5, then Black follows with either ...b5 and queenside play, or ...f5 and an eventual kingside attack. Meanwhile, White attempts to expand on the opposite wing. The resulting unbalanced positions offer scope for both sides to play for a win.
The earliest known use of the term "Indian Defence" was in 1884. The modern names "King's Indian Defence", "King's Indian Attack", etc. arose in the mid-twentieth century and are attributed toHans Kmoch. Until the mid-1930s, the King's Indian Defence was generally regarded as highly suspect, but the analysis and play of three strong Soviet players in particular—Alexander Konstantinopolsky,Isaac Boleslavsky, andDavid Bronstein—helped to make the defence much more respected and popular. It is a dynamic opening, exceptionally complex, and a favourite of formerworld championsGarry Kasparov,Bobby Fischer, andMikhail Tal, with prominentgrandmastersViktor Korchnoi,Miguel Najdorf,Efim Geller,John Nunn,Svetozar Gligorić,Wolfgang Uhlmann, andIlya Smirinhaving also contributed much to the theory and practice of this opening.
In the early 2000s the opening's popularity suffered afterVladimir Kramnikbegan scoring excellently against it, so much so that Kasparov gave up the opening after several critical losses to Kramnik. However, Kramnik himself won a game on the black side of the KID in 2012,[1]and current top players includingHikaru Nakamura,Teimour Radjabov, andDing Lirenplay the opening.
The main variations of the King's Indian are:
TheClassical Variationis 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.Nf3 0-0 6.Be2 e5.
A minor but still significant sideline occurs for White on move 6, with 6.Bg5, the Zinnowitz Variation, instead of 6.Be2 e5. The line was played several times by German GrandmasterBurkhard Malichin the 1960s and 1970s.[3]It is currently unfashionable at master level; Black gets a good game with either 6...h6 or 6...Nbd7. This line is distinct from the much more popular Averbakh Variation, described below, since in the Zinnowitz, White has played 5.Nf3 instead of 5.Be2, as in the Averbakh, and then follows with 6.Bg5.
Another, more significant and quite popular sideline occurs for Black on move 6, with 6...Bg4, in place of the mainline 6...e5. One idea for Black here is to relieve their somewhat cramped position by exchanging their light-squared bishop, which is often relegated to a passive role in the King's Indian. White's most popular response is 7.Be3, similar to the Gligoric System (see above); White seems to retain a small edge in every variation. Top players who have used this line for Black include two former World Champions: GMsMikhail TalandBoris Spassky.[4]
After 6...c5 7.O-O cxd4 8.Nxd4 Nc6, the game transposes into theAccelerated Dragonvariation of theSicilian Defence.
TheSämisch Variationis 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.f3. It is named afterFriedrich Sämisch, who developed the system in the 1920s. This often leads to very sharp play with the players castling on opposite wings and attacking each other's kings, as in the Bagirov–Gufeld game given below, though it may also give rise to heavyweight positional struggles. Black has a variety of pawn breaks, such as ...e5, ...c5 and ...b5 (prepared by ...c6 and/or ...a6). This can transpose to theModern Benoniafter 5...0-0 6.Bg5 c5 7.d5 e6. World championsMikhail Botvinnik,Mikhail Tal,Tigran Petrosian,Boris Spassky,Anatoly KarpovandGarry Kasparovhave all played this variation. This line defends the e4-pawn to create a secure centre and enables White to begin an attack kingside with Be3, Qd2, Bh6, g2–g4 and h2–h4. It allows placement of a bishop on e3 without allowing ...Ng4; however, its drawback is that it deprives the knight on g1 of its most natural square, thus impeding development of the kingside. Black can strike for the centre as previously mentioned or delay with 6...Nc6, 7...a6 and 8...Rb8 so that Black can play ...b7–b5 to open lines on the queenside.
The Classical Defence to the Sämisch is 5...0-0 6.Be3 e5, when White has a choice between closing the centre with 7.d5, or maintaining the tension with 7.Nge2. Kasparov was a major proponent of this defence.[5]
The Sämisch Gambit arises after 5...0-0 6.Be3 c5. This is a pawn sacrifice, and was once considered dubious. As Black's play has been worked out, this evaluation has changed, and the gambit now enjoys a good reputation. A practical drawback, however, is that a well-prepared but unambitious White player can often enter lines leading to a forceddraw.[5]The line where White accepts the gambit runs 5...0-0 6.Be3 c5 7.dxc5 dxc5 8.Qxd8 (8.e5 Nfd7 9.f4 f6 10.exf6 is also possible here, though less often seen) Rxd8 9.Bxc5 Nc6. Black's activity is believed to give sufficient compensation. White's most frequent play is to decline the gambit, and instead play 7.Nge2, and head for Benoni type positions after a d4–d5 advance. However, after 7...cxd4 (preventing the d4-d5 advance) 8.Nxd4 Nc6, the game transposes into theAccelerated Dragonvariation of theSicilian Defence.
5...0-0 6.Be3 Nc6 7.Nge2 a6 8.Qd2 Rb8 leads to thePanno Variationof the Sämisch. Black prepares to respond appropriately depending on White's choice of plan. If White plays 0-0-0 and goes for a kingside attack, then 7...a6 prepares ...b7–b5 with a counterattack against White's castled position. If instead White plays more cautiously, then Black challenges White's centre with ...e5.
TheAverbakh Variationis 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.Be2 0-0 6.Bg5 (named forYuri Averbakh), which prevents the immediate 6...e5 (6...e5?7. dxe5 dxe5 8. Qxd8 Rxd8 9. Nd5 Nxd5 (If black doesn't play Nxd5, black loses the f6 knight)10. Bxd8 Nb6 11.  Bxc7 White is up an exchange and a pawn, the endgame should be winning for white.)
Black often repels the bishop with ...h6 giving them the option of a later g5, though in practice this is a weakening move. White has various ways to develop, such as Qd2, Nf3, f4 or even h4. However, Black obtains good play against all of these development schemes.
The old main line in this begins with 6...c5 (which keeps the long diagonal open).
However, 6...Nbd7 and 6...Na6 (Judit Polgár's move) are also seen.
It is possible that theAverbakh System(of the Modern Defense) can transition to the Averbakh Variation of the King's Indian Defence.
TheFour Pawns Attackcontinues with 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.f4 0-0 6.Nf3. This is the most aggressive method for White, and was often seen in the 1920s. With their fifth move, White erects a massive centre at the price of falling behind in development. If Black can open the position, White may well find themselves overextended. From this 6...c5 is the main line.
TheFianchettoVariation1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nf3 Bg7 4.g3 0-0 5.Bg2 d6 6.0-0, is named for White's development of light-squared bishop to g2, and is one of the most popular lines at the grandmaster level,Korchnoionce its most notable practitioner. This method of development is on completely different lines than other King's Indian variations. Here, Black's normal plan of attack can hardly succeed, as White's kingside is more solidly defended than in most KID variations. The most common responses are:
Finally, White has other setups, such as Nf3 and h3 and Nge2 (with or without Bd3), but these are currently not as popular at the grandmaster level. 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.Nge2 followed by 6.Ng3 is called theHungarian Attack.
One of the earliest examples:
One of the most famous King's Indian games was abrilliancyby the lateUkrainian-American grandmasterEduard Gufeld, who called it his "Mona Lisa":[8]

## Larsens Opening
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Nimzowitsch-Larsen-Attack)
The opening move 1.b3 is a quite playable way for White to begin a game. It is named for the great Danish GMBent Larsen, who was known for his offbeat style. It is sometimes also known as the Nimzowitsch-Larsen or Nimzo-Larsen Attack after Larsen and the Latvian-Danish GMAron Nimzowitsch.
Like most openings that do not begin with 1.e4 or 1.d4, Larsen's Opening is immediately identifiable from White's first move. It is the sixth-most popular opening move for White in theChess.com Masters databaseafter 1.e4, 1.d4, 1.c4, 1.Nf3, and 1.g3.
Although White immediately steers the game in a specific direction with Larsen's Opening, Black has several reasonable ways of meeting it. The three most popular first moves for Black are 1...e5, 1...d5, and 1...Nf6.
The first of those moves is most popular, even though White's usual second move, the natural 2. Bb2, attacks that pawn. Fortunately for Black, it's very easy to defend naturally with either 2...d6 or 2...Nc6, both of which aid development as well.
The most popular second move after 1...d5 is 2...Nf6, and the most popular second move after 1...Nf6 is 2...d5. In either order, Black does not give White a pawn to attack. White is usually playing Bb2 and Nf3 in some order on moves two and three.
As with any chess position, the potential tree of moves quickly explodes. White usually plays the opening as part of a broader system that also includes the pawn moves c4 and e3. Black is looking to develop naturally and get a playable game.
Black doesn't problems after 1...e5 or 1...d5. If you open with 1.e4 as White, then it's easiest to play 1...e5 as Black here, and if you're more of a 1.d4 player, try 1...d5. There's no reason to get fancy.
No matter what variation Black might play against 1. b3, the idea is much the same. White is trying to control the center from the flank and Black's main responses are to occupy it with at least one pawn.
The earliest record of 1. b3 in a serious game came all the way back in 1851 when it was played by the Dutchman Maarten van't Kruijs. However, it was Nimzowitsch who first became identified with the opening. He played it three times from 1927-29 and won, drew, and lost once each. It remained a quite rare opening up until the mid-1960s when GM Vladimir Simagin began playing it occasionally.
Finally, in 1968, Larsen played it for the first of dozens of times, beginning at a tournament in Monte Carlo. Larsen came away the victor at the tournament with a 9.5/13 score, although he drew both games he played the opening in. GM Bobby Fischer picked up on it and had success in 1970, defeating GM Miroslav Filip and GMHenrique Meckingwith it at the Palma de Mallorca Interzonal.
Amusingly, when Fischer and Larsen played each other in the 1971 Candidates, the opening did not arise. Fischer never actually played the opening again, although Larsen continued to do so. Larsen's Opening remains a respectable option for White to this day, especially if wanting to avoid main lines following 1.e4, 1.d4, or the English. Top bullet players like Nakamura, Carlsen, and Nepomniachtchi still play it in blitz and bullet.
Perhaps the best-known win for White in the Larsen Opening was instead played by Fischer in his matchup against Mecking in the 1970 Interzonal. Fischer also defeated GMUlf Anderssonand GM Vladimir Tukmakov with the opening at other events in 1970.
However, by far the most famous game with 1.b3 was a win for Black. Larsen himself played 1.b3 in the game, but unfortunately for him, it was a 17-move brilliancy for his opponent GMBoris Spassky. Spassky played for rapid development and was rewarded with a quickly winning position that included a spectacular 14th move.

# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimzowitsch-Larsen_Attack)
TheNimzowitsch-Larsen Attack(also known as theNimzo-Larsen Attack,Larsen's OpeningandQueen's Fianchetto Opening) is achess openingtypically starting with the move: 1.b3but sometimes introduced by themove order1.Nf3 and then 2.b3. Theflank openingmove 1.b3 prepares tofianchettothequeen's bishopwhere it will help control thecentral squaresinhypermodernfashion and put pressure on Black'skingside.
Lines are classified under codes A01–A06 in theEncyclopaedia of Chess Openings.
The earliest master-level exponent of the Nimzowitsch-Larsen Attack was the strong English amateurJohn Owen, who occasionally opened this way in the 1870s – essentially playingOwen's Defence, 1.e4 b6, with a move in hand.
In the 1920s and 30s,Aron Nimzowitschexperimented with 1.b3 but more commonly employed the move order 1.Nf3 d5 2.b3, usually reaching positions akin to areversedNimzo-Indian Defence (e.g. after 2...Nf6 3.Bb2 c5 4.e3 Nc6 5.Bb5).
Danishgrandmaster(GM)Bent Larsenplayed 1.b3 frequently between 1968 and 1972, but the opening suffered a setback in the 1970USSR vs. Rest of the Worldmatch inBelgrade, where Larsen played it against reigningworld championBoris Spasskyand lost in 17 moves.[2]
The Nimzowitsch-Larsen Attack received interest fromBobby Fischer, who employed 1.b3 on five occasions in 1970. A notable longer-term exponent of the opening, however, was Soviet GMVladimir Bagirovwho played 1.b3 on around 100 occasions between 1976 and 2000 with considerable success (scoring approximately 54% wins and 38% draws). Recent specialists in this opening have included Czech GMPavel Blatnyand Armenian GMArtashes Minasian. The Nimzowitsch-Larsen Attack is sometimes used as a surprise weapon in super-GM-level online blitz tournaments, including byHikaru Nakamura,Magnus Carlsen,Richárd Rapport,Ian Nepomniachtchi,Vladislav ArtemievandBaadur Jobava.
If Black responds to 1.b3 with 1...e5, White has essentially two options, to allow or prevent ...d5. The main choice has been to proceed in truehypermodernstyle, allowing Black to form a classical e5/d5pawn centrethat White will then undermine. For example: 1.b3 e5 2.Bb2 Nc6 3.e3 d5 4.Bb5 (threatening Bxc6+ and Bxe5) 4...Bd6 5.f4 (further attacking the e5-pawn, which cannot take due to  Bxg7 winning the h8-rook) and now 5...Qe7 or 5...f6 (in either case defending the pawn again). This type of line is very much in the spirit ofOwen'soriginal conception of the opening.
The alternative for White has been to contest the d5-square, rather in the style of a reversedSicilian Defence, i.e.: 1.b3 e5 2.Bb2 Nc6 3.c4 (see diagram). In this case Black can proceed either as per the Open Sicilian (e.g. 3...Nf6 4.e3 d5 5.cxd5 Nxd5) or as per the Closed Sicilian (e.g. 3...g6 4.e3 Bg7 5.Nf3 with ...f5 and/or ...Nf6 to follow).
After 3.c4, the opening could be said to havetransposedto anEnglish Opening(1.c4), but these lines occur almost exclusively via a 1.b3 move order. In this variation, White argues that since the Sicilian Defence (1.e4 c5) is one of the very best responses to 1.e4, acquiring a Sicilian Defence position with an extra move must be superior. In the Sicilian Defence, however, Black rarely plays b6/Bb7, and when aqueensidefianchetto is played it is usually in extended form (e.g. a6/b5/Bb7). Play after 1.b3 e5 2.Bb2 Nc6 3.c4 Nf6 4.e3 d5 5.cxd5 Nxd5 is likely to resemble a quietHedgehog-type line from the Paulsen Sicilian.
Returning to Black's first move, if Black responds to 1.b3 with 1...d5 then White again has two options, whether to prevent or allow ...e5. If ...e5 is allowed then transposition will likely occur to the lines given above after 1...e5. If White chooses to prevent ...e5, for example with 2.Bb2 c5 3.e3 Nc6 4.Nf3, then play often takes the form of a reversedNimzo-Indian Defenceafter 4...Nf6 5.Bb5 (diagram). This type of position often arises from a 1.Nf3 move order (e.g. 1.Nf3 d5 2.b3 etc.) and demonstrates Nimzowitsch's interpretation of the opening.
The Nimzo-Indian Defence is a popular defence to 1.d4, and in this case White has obtained a version withcolours reversedand an extratempo.
The notes above give the three typical branches of the Nimzowitsch-Larsen Attack: (1) playing against an e5/d5 centre, (2) allowing ...e5 but contesting ...d5 and (3) playing against a d5/c5 centre. Alternative first moves for Black (such as 1...Nf6, 1...c5 and 1...e6) are likely to transpose to either the e5/d5 or d5/c5 lines already considered. Other Black structures give White more freedom in handling the opening. For example, if Black opts for 1.b3 e5 2.Bb2 d6, then White can proceed with either (a) e3 and Ne2 and then contest the Black centre with d4 or f4, depending on how Black continues, or (b) c4, interpreting the opening as a reversed Closed Sicilian or as a type of English Opening.
One independent option available to Black is to play a reversed kind ofLondon Systemwith d5, Bf5, Nf6, e6, c6, etc. In this case White may change tack and play adouble fianchetto, forcing through e2–e4 (via d3, Nd2 and Bg2) and disrupting Black's soliddevelopment. For example, 1.b3 d5 2.Bb2 Bf5 3.d3 e6 4.Nd2 Nf6 5.g3 Be7 6.Bg2 h6 7.e4 Bh7 reaches a form ofHippopotamus structure.
The issue of whether to play the Nimzowitsch-Larsen Attack via a 1.b3 move order or a 1.Nf3/2.b3 move order is ultimately a matter of taste. The 1.Nf3 move order could be argued to limit the number of variations at Black's disposal and to channel the play towards those where White scores more highly. The 1.b3 move order, on the other hand, gives more variety and more scope for tricks and traps on the a1–h8 diagonal. It is also more likely to result in positions with which Black is unfamiliar. For example, after 1.Nf3 d5 2.b3, any Black players who open 1.d4 with White will be likely to have some awareness of the strategic considerations required to play a reversed Nimzo-Indian position. After 1.b3 e5 2.Bb2, however, Black is unlikely to have had much experience facing comparable positions as White in the rather rareOwen's Defence, and in this case has colours reversed and is a move down. While many of the 1.b3 lines are rated onlyequalby theory, the 1.b3 player will thus often enjoy an advantage in practical terms, especially at shortertime controls.
Jacobs & Tait[3]note that the 1.b3 move order has the added advantage that in most lines White has a greater range of options available because f4 is still playable. This is particularly relevant when compared to lines such as 1.Nf3 d6 2.b3 or 1.Nf3 Nc6 2.b3 where Black is able to play 2...e5, transposing to lines where White may have preferred to have had the option to attack e5 with both f4 and Nf3. Jacobs & Tait also note that a 1.Nf3 move order allows Black to play 1...g6, preventing White from following up with 2.b3.

## Latvian Gambit
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Kings-Pawn-Opening-Latvian-Gambit)
TheLatvian Gambitis an aggressive opening that Black can try against 1.e4. Although usually not seen in master games, this opening is playable among club-level players due to its many tactical traps.
The Latvian Gambit starts with the moves1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f5. Black offers not one but two pawns right on their second move. White can take either the e- or the f-pawn, and Black's idea is to eventually strive for better center control. Usually, a tactical slugfest follows, with both sides having to play sharp chess to come out on top.
Objectively speaking, White has a better position after Black enters the Latvian Gambit.
White can either accept or decline the gambit, although accepting it is the best way to refute Black's opening. White concedes equality for Black by declining the gambit, in which games Black even has the better score among masters.
The most challenging way for White to meet Black's opening is by accepting the gambit with1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f5 3.Nxe5. White takes Black's pawn and threatens the immediate 4.Qh5+, which can be devastating. Because of this threat, Black usually responds with the exotic-looking3...Qf6or with3...Nc6.
From there, a complicated game usually follows, with Black trying to keep a pawn in the center and both sides making tactical threats.
The other way to accept the gambit is with1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f5 3.exf5, though this variation is less challenging than 3...Nxe5. In a way, Black gets what they want by diverting the white pawn from the center. From there, Black can play aggressively with 3...e4, attacking the enemy knight. Another option is to play 3...d6, supporting their e-pawn and hoping to recapture White's f5-pawn while developing the light-squared bishop.
The Greco Variation of the Latvian Gambit starts after1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f5 3.Nxe5 Qe7. While this is not the best or most-played option for Black, it is a very old move, made famous by Italian masterGiochino Grecoin the 1600s. Black invites White to play 4.Qh5+ in the hopes of winning an exchange. White can go for the check and even win the exchange, but must be careful with a few traps Black can play to turn the game around.
Below, you can see two games played by Greco in this variation:
The most common way of declining the gambit is with1. e4 e5 2.Nf3 f5 3.Bc4, the Mayet Attack. While the engine claims equality, Black scores better in this variation. This is because White's idea of attacking the f7-square leads nowhere, and White does not have the time to exploit the weak h5-e8 diagonal.
The Latvian Gambit is one of the oldest chess openings recorded in history, being analyzed byPedro Damianoas early as 1512. A century later, another famous chess master, Greco, used this opening in a few beautiful games—giving the opening its other name, the Greco Counter-Gambit.
Around the 1900s, a few notable Latvian players, likeAron Nimzowitsch, popularized the opening even further. From then on, the opening was renamed the Latvian Gambit.
While there are some games where Black employs the Latvian Gambit to defeat well-known names like a young GMBobby Fischer, it's rare to see masters playing it. However, club players still adopt this opening to this day, despite its dubious reputation.

TheLatvian Gambit(orGreco Countergambit) is achess openingcharacterised by the moves:
It is one of the oldest chess openings, having been analysed in the 16th century byGiulio Cesare Polerioand then the 17th century byGioachino Greco, after whom it is sometimes named. The opening has the appearance of aKing's Gambitwithcolours reversed. It is an aggressive but objectively dubious opening for Black which often leads to wild and tricky positions.[1][2]FIDE Master Dennis Monokroussos even goes so far as to describe it as "possibly the worst opening in chess".[3]WhilePaul van der Sterrenobserves:
What is required to play the Latvian Gambit with any degree of success is a sharp eye for tactics and a mental attitude of total contempt for whatever theory has to say about it.
The Latvian is, and has always been, uncommon in top-levelover-the-boardplay, but somecorrespondenceplayers are devotees.[2][4]
TheECOcode for the Latvian Gambit is C40 (King's Knight Opening).
The opening was originally known as theGreco Countergambit, and some modern writers still refer to it as such.[5]That name recognised the Italian playerGioachino Greco(1600–1634), who contributed to the early theory of the opening. The nameLatvian Gambitis a tribute to severalLatvianplayers who analysed it,Kārlis Bētiņšbeing the most prominent among them. The AustrianInternational Master(IM)Albert Beckeronce published an article that Bētiņš judged to be dismissive about the Latvian Gambit. In response, Bētiņš published and analysed one of his own games in order to defend the gambit: Ilyin-Zhenevsky vs K Bētiņ, 1921.
According to most, the opening's only advantage is its ostensible novelty value, since, irrespective of what level you play at, the chances of your opponent even knowing this opening, let alone knowing the best lines for White, are low. However, it has been used byBoris Spassky[6]andMikhail Chigorin,[7]amongst many others; albeit, usually in casual play. Most notably, evenBobby Fischer[8]andJosé Raúl Capablanca[9]have lost to it. Sweden'sJonny Hectoris one of the fewgrandmastersto play it in serious competition; he has argued that it is not as bad as its reputation and that even with best play White's advantage is not large.[10]
White's 3.Nxe5 is considered the main line against the Latvian. After the usual 3...Qf6, the traditional main line has been 4.d4 d6 5.Nc4 fxe4, however recently the immediate 4.Nc4 (theLeonhardtVariation) has become popular.
4.Nc4 has the advantage of allowing White to open thecentrewith d3, for example 4...fxe4 5.Nc3 Qg6?! 6.d3 exd3? 7.Bxd3 Qxg2? and now White is winning after 8.Qh5+ Kd8 (or 8...g6 9.Qe5+ and 10.Be4) 9.Be4. If 6... Bb4, however, White must be careful following the same line, e.g. 7.Bd2 exd3 8.Bxd3 Qxg2 9.Qh5+ Kd8 10.Be4 Nf6! because now if White plays Bg5, which would be necessary to win the queen in the earlier line, then ...Bxc3+ wins for Black. The main line continues 5...Qf7 6.Ne3! Black usually responds with 6...c6!?, when White can either accept thepawnsacrificewith 7.Nxe4 d5 8.Ng5 Qf6 9.Nf3, or decline it with the more popular 7.d3 exd3 8.Bxd3 d5 9.0-0.[11]The latter variation has been deeply analysed; the BritishgrandmasterAnthony Kostenanalyses one line to move 32.[12]One line discussed by IMJeremy Silmanis 9...Bc5 10.Na4 Bd6 11.c4 d4 12.Nc2 c5 13.b4 Ne7 14.Nxc5 Bxc5 15.bxc5 Nbc6 16.Bb2 0–0 17.Nxd4 Nxd4 18.Bxd4 Bf5 19.Bxf5 Nxf5 20.Be3 Qxc4 21.Qb3 Nxe3!? 22.fxe3 Rxf1+ 23.Rxf1 Qxb3 24.axb3 Rc8 25.Rf5 and now 25...Rd8 or 25...Rc6 gives Black an excellent chance todrawthe pawn-downendgame.[13]Silman later argued that 10.b4!! and now 10...Bxb4 11.Ncxd5 cxd5 12.Nxd5 or 10...Bd6 11.Re1! Ne7 12.Nexd5 cxd5 13.Nb5 is close to winning for White, and that the "old, discredited" 9...Bd6 (rather than 9...Bc5) might be Black's best try, though still insufficient forequality.[14]
A possible continuation after 4.d4 is 4...d6 5.Nc4 fxe4 6.Nc3 Qg6 7.f3 exf3 8.Qxf3 Nf6 9.Bd3 Qg4 10.Qe3+ Qe6 11.0-0 Qxe3+ 12.Bxe3 Be7 13.Rae1 0-0. White is better here, but Black has chances due to White's misplaced king and weak light squares.
Also possible is the eccentric 3...Nc6?!, against whichJohn Nunnrecommends 4.d4, preferring principled opening play to the unclear tactics resulting from 4.Qh5+. After 4.d4, if 4...Qh4? (Kosten's original recommendation) 5.Nf3! Qxe4+ 6.Be2 leaves Black with a lost position.[15]After 4.d4, Kosten analyses 4...Qf6!? 5.Nc3 Bb4 6.exf5! Nxe5 7.Qe2.[16]
Instead of 4.d4, Kosten says that White can accept the proffered rook with 4.Qh5+ g6 5.Nxg6 Nf6 6.Qh3 hxg6 7.Qxh8 Qe7 (7...fxe4? 8.d4! is strong) 8.d3! (Stefan Bücker gives an alternative 8.Nc3! Nb4 9.d3 as also winning for White)[17]8...fxe4 9.Be3 d5 10.Bc5! Qxc5 11.Qxf6 Bf5 12.dxe4 Nd4 13.exf5! Nxc2+ 14.Kd1 Nxa1 15.Bd3 Qd6 16.Re1+ Kd7 17.Qf7+ Be7 18.Re6 winning.[18]
White's 3.Bc4 may lead to perhaps the most notorious and heavily analysed line of the Latvian, which begins 3...fxe4 4.Nxe5 Qg5 5.d4 Qxg2 6.Qh5+ g6 7.Bf7+ Kd8 8.Bxg6! Qxh1+ 9.Ke2 Qxc1 (9...c6 is a major alternative) 10.Nf7+ Ke8 11.Nxh8+ hxg6 12.Qxg6+ Kd8 13.Nf7+ Ke7 14.Nc3! (diagram).[19]
Instead of 4...Qg5, however, "nowadays players often give preference to 4...d5", the Svedenborg[20]or Polerio[21]Variation. According to Latvian Gambit experts Kon Grivainis and John Elburg, Black wins more often than White in this line.[22]After 4...d5 5.Qh5+ g6 6.Nxg6, Black chooses between 6...Nf6 and 6...hxg6. 6...Nf6 usually leads, after 7.Qe5+ Be7 8.Bb5+! (a smallzwischenzugto deprive Black's knight of the c6-square) 8...c6 9.Nxe7 Qxe7 10.Qxe7+ Kxe7 11.Be2 (or 11.Bf1), to an endgame where Black is a pawn down but has positionalcompensation.[23]Sharper is 6...hxg6, when 7.Qxh8 Kf7 9.Qd4 Be6 gives White a largematerialadvantage, but his "position is constantly on the edge of a precipice", and the line has accordingly fallen out of favour.[24]More often, White plays 7.Qxg6+ Kd7 8.Bxd5 Nf6, leading to sharp andunclearplay.[25]
Black's best response is 3...fxe4. Some sample continuations are
Assessment: Black is usually down material, but has excellent compensation. Most of White's pieces are still on the back rank. IM Mio argues Black is better.[26]
Several other responses for White have been analysed.[27]
White's 3.Nc3 was originally analysed by the AmericanmasterStasch Mlotkowski(1881–1943) in the 1916British Chess Magazine.[28]Kosten gives as Black's two main responses 3...Nf6 4.Bc4 (4.exf5 is also possible) fxe4 5.Nxe5 d5 6.Nxd5! Nxd5 7.Qh5+ g6 8.Nxg6! hxg6! 9.Qxg6+ Kd7 10.Bxd5 Qe7 11.Qxe4 Rh4 12.Qxe7+ Bxe7, reaching anendgamewhere White has four pawns for aminor piece, and 4...fxe4 5.Nxe5 Qf6, when White can choose from 6.Nc4! (transposing to the main line 3.Nxe5 Qf6 4.Nc4 fxe4 6.Nc3), 6.d4, and 6.f4!?[29]Black can also play 3...d6, when 4.d4transposesto thePhilidor Countergambit(1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 f5!?), which was favoured byPaul Morphyin the mid-19th century and is still seen occasionally today.[28][30]
Today, however, Black's response is considered to be 3...fxe4.
Assessment: One of the best lines for Black. Black has better bishops and a strong centre.
White's 3.exf5 followed by 3...e4 4.Ne5 Nf6 5.Be2 is recommended byJohn L. WatsonandEric Schiller.[31]4.Qe2, 4.Nd4, and even 4.Ng1!? are also possible.[32]
Black's response should be 3...e4.
Now, White has three possible moves:
Sample Continuation #1 4.Ne5 Nf6 5.Be2 d6 6.Bh5+ Ke7! 7.Nf7 Qe8 8.Nxh8 Nxh5 9.Nc3 Kd8
Sample Continuation #2 4.Nd4 Nf6 5.d3 c5 6.Nb3 exd3 7.Bxd3 d5 8.Bb5+ Nc6
Common mistake 4.Qe2?Qe7 5.Nd4 Nc6 6.Qh5+ Kd8 7.Nxc6+ dxc6 8.Be2 Nf6 9.Qg5 h6 10.Qe3 Bxf5 11.0-0 Nd5 12.Qd4 Qd6 13.d3 Nb4
Assessment: While Black is not lost here, this variation is hard to play for Black. It often involves Ke7, allowing Nf7 and saccing the kingside rook.
White's 3.d4 followed by 3...fxe4 4.Nxe5 Nf6 5.Bg5 d6 leads, as usual, to sharp play. White often offers a piecesacrificewith either 6.Nc3!? or 6.Nd2!?, but Black seems to have adequate resources against both.[33]
Black's best response is considered to be 3...fxe4.
Sample Continuation #1 4.Nxe5 Nf6 5.Be2 d6 6.Nc4 Be6 7.Ne3 d5 8.c4 c6 9.Nc3 Be7 10.0-0 0-0
Common mistake  8.O-O?c5!
Sample Continuation #2 4.Nxe5 Nf6 5.Be2 d6 6.Ng4 Be7 7.Nc3 d5 8.Ne5 O-O 9.Bg5 c6 10.O-O Bf5
Assessment: Black has a better pawn structure, and better bishops. Few openings give you such a good position after just 10 moves.
This passive move does not promise White any advantage. After 3...Nc6 4.Nc3 Nf6 5.exf5 d5, Black is okay. Alternatively, 3...d6 4.Nc3 Nf6 5.g3 Be7 6.Bg2 is also considered a prudent defense by Black.[34]Black's best response is 3...Nc6.
Sample continuation #1 4.Nc3 Nc6 5.exf5 d5
Sample continuation #2 4.Nc3 Nc6 5.Bg5 Bb4 6.exf5 d5 7.a3 Bxc3+ 8.bxc3 Bxf5
Assessment: Normal position that is comparable to several other openings. White has a weak pawn structure but the bishop pair. However, this is a tough advantage to prove, since White's light-squared bishop is restricted.

## Locock Gambit
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/forum/view/chess-openings/locock-gambit)

Maybe it worked during the days of Morphy.
After Black accepts the gambit with 5. ... Kxf7 White can play a very nice 6. dxe5 threatening to win the Knight back with interest because Black's Queen is left hanging.
I'm not sure what the book move is, but 6. ... Qe7 looks okay off the top of my head. This pretty much forces White to trade Queens, and material is even. Black's King is left in the center, but White doesn't look like he has enough punch to generate a decent attack. The resulting position looks drawish, even at the club level.
I cannot find this opening on any opening databases.  Only wikipedia.

The Locock Gambit is a very aggressive line in the Philidor Defense and starts with the moves:
1.e4 e52.Nf3 d63.d4 Nf64.Ng5 h65.Nxf7
The Philidor Defense is generally pretty passive. When you start out with e5 and d6 you are playing for a very long game by building up a strong pawn structure. This can be very frustrating for many players starting out with e4 because they are looking for an aggressive start.
With the Locock Gambit, white is able to regain the initiative and play a very aggressive line. The knight is sacrificed and in exchange, white is able to launch a strong attack against black

## London System
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/London-System)
The London System is a popular 1.d4 opening for White which has the reputation of being very solid. The London is considered a system because White can play the same basic setup for almost all of Black's responses. For this reason, the theory on the London is not as extensive as it is for other openings.
White enters theLondon Systemwhen playing Bf4 before pushing a pawn to e3, usually through1.d4 d5 2.Bf4. Note that the old mainline was 1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Bf4, but the current theory states that playing2.Bf4instead of2.Nf3is slightly more accurate.
This opening's main idea is to create a solid pawn structure in the center by pushing pawns to c3 and e3, but only after developing the dark-squared bishop outside the pawn chain. Despite its being a solid opening by nature, the London also features aggressive lines and can catch Black off guard.
One of the advantages of the London System is that White will almost always play the same setup. Below are a few of the most common paths a London game can take:
The London's mainline leads to a balanced position where White will usually go for an attack on the kingside. On the other hand, Black will play for a central break or a counter-attack on the queenside:
1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Nf6 3. e3 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nd2 e6 6. Ngf3 Bd6 7. Bg3 O-O 8. Bd3 b6 9. Qe2 Bb7.
One of the most common responses from Black to the London System is to play an Indian Setup, fianchettoeing the dark-squared bishop. Black puts a pawn on g6 to discourage White from developing the light-squared bishop to the active d3-square.
White's most popular moves against this setup are almost identical to the mainline, except for the light-squared bishop developing to e2 instead of d3.
1.d4 Nf6 2.Bf4 g6 3.Nf3 Bg7 4.e3 d6

A setup that has been gaining popularity over the past years is the Jobava London. White develops the b-knight to c3, where they would usually put a pawn, to give it a more active square. The Jobava London can turn into a much sharper game, and White can get a significant advantage if Black plays incorrectly.
1.d4 Nf6 2.Nc3 d5 3.Bf4

If Black is familiar with how to face London System, there is not much White can do to create a significant advantage out of the opening. The mainline is an excellent way to equalize the game and create a balanced position. However, Black can try more testing lines that will force the White player to get out of their "comfort zone," notably:
Black scores well in this line, winning 49% of the games, drawing 23%, and losing only 22%. The idea is to bring the queen out to the queenside with 3...Qb6, where White's dark-square bishop can't help. Black puts pressure on the b-pawn and the center, later fianchettoing their dark-squared bishop on g7.
1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 c5
Note that a well-prepared London player will know this line and should be able to fight against it by deviating slightly from the usual white setup. White's best response is3.d5, which is not within the realm of the London System. As Black, you should be ready to play this line.
Another good try for Black is to go with the Indian setup with ...d6. Out of more than 2,000 games in our database, Black won 38%, drew 31%, and lost 31%. This line's main moves usually involve a slow and equal game, where Black will develop both their bishops in fianchetto. White will try to expand on the kingside and Black on the queenside.
1.d4 Nf6 2.Bf4 g6 3.Nf3 Bg7 4.e3 d6.
As with the other line, the prepared White player will know that deviating from the London moves is their best chance to gain an advantage. Once more, White can get out of the London System and play3.Nc3to get an edge, so you need to prepare for this.
Developing the dark-squared bishop to f4 and outside the pawn chain is a natural idea that has been played for centuries. However, this opening gained popularity at the top level after the 1922 London Congress, especially after the match between GMsAlexander AlekhineandMax Euwe.
More recently, the opening gained popularity after world championMagnus Carlsenadopted it as part of his repertoire.
The London System has been widely played by top players throughout the ages. Carlsen and GMGata Kamskyare more recent examples of players who employed it with great success in their careers.
Below we can see a game between Kamsky and GMSam Shankland. Kamsky employed one of the London's main ideas, creating a quick and deadly attack on the kingside. The game illustrates some tactical aspects of the opening.
The second game features Carlsen in his 2020 rapid game against GMDing Liren. Carlsen introduced a novelty with 7.Bxd6, sacrificing a pawn for a positional advantage that proved to be too much for the Chinese supergrandmaster to handle.
You now know what the London System is, how to reach it, and a few ways to counter it. If you want to learn more about this opening, check out ourMasters Databaseand study the games of the world's best players.

# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_System)
TheLondon Systemis anopening systeminchesswhere White opens with1.d4and develops thedark-squared bishopto f4, then supports the d4-pawn with pawns on e3 and c3. The other bishop is developed to d3 (or occasionally e2) and the knights typically to f3 and d2. This set-up often results in aclosed game. The London System can be used against virtually any Black defence and thus comprises a smaller body ofopening theorythan many other openings. Although it has a reputation as asolidopening, the London System has faced criticism for its tedious nature and lack ofdynamic play.[1][2][3][4][5][6]
The rapiddevelopmentof the dark-squared bishop in the London System can be contrasted with theColle System, in which thequeen's bishoptypically remains on c1 during the opening phase of the game.[7]
The British-AmericanJames Masonwas the firstmaster-level player to regularly employ the London System, including at the strong 1882 Vienna Tournament (in which he finished third) and later at tournaments at London (1883) and New York (1889). The opening did not catch on, and received limited outings in master play in subsequent decades. It did, however, appear with some regularity in the games of certain masters, includingF.J. Lee,Joseph Henry BlackburneandAkiba Rubinstein.
The nameLondon Systemderives from the reappearance of the opening on seven occasions in the very strong London tournament of 1922, including in games byJosé Raúl Capablanca,Alexander Alekhineand Akiba Rubinstein. After this tournament the opening remained rare in master practice, but the London set-up soon became the standard response forBlackagainst theRéti Opening(this line being named the New York Variation, after its use inRéti–Capablanca during theNew York 1924 tournament.
Although the London System remains rare ingrandmastertournaments, it has been played occasionally by players includingBent Larsen,Tony Miles,Teimour Radjabov,Vladimir KramnikandFabiano Caruana, and more frequently by players such asGata Kamsky,Levon AronianandMagnus Carlsen. During the 21st century the London System has become popular amongst club-level players due to its solid nature, clear plans and lack of aggressive responses by Black. One of the most famous games of the 21st century utilizing the London System wasround 6of the 2023 World Chess Championship betweenDing LirenandIan Nepomniachtchi.
The London System consists of a set-up for White employing the following moves (which can be played in a variety ofmove orders): d4, Nf3, Bf4, e3, Bd3, Nbd2, c3. The move h3 is often also played, enabling the bishop on f4 to drop back to h2 if attacked, thus remaining on the same diagonal and continuing to influence e5.
Following the publication of the influential 2005 workWin with the London Systemby Sverre Johnsen andVlatko Kovačević, it has become common for White to prefer to develop the queen's bishop to f4 on move 2 (rather than opting for 2.Nf3 and then 3.Bf4, as had previously been common). Johnsen and Kovačević note that, in the case of 2.Nf3, if play proceeds 2...c5 3.Bf4?!, then 3...cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nd7 "may already be better for Black".[8]Meanwhile,Kiril Georgievnotes inFighting the London Systemthat "The idea of delaying the [Nf3] development is to avoid the famous line [1.d4 d5] 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Bf4 c5 4.e3 Nc6 5.c3 Qb6 6.Qb3 c4 7.Qc2 Bf5, when White should retreat [the queen] ingloriously to c1."[9]
White's future plans will depend upon Black's choice of set-up. Black has a particularly wide range of possibilities in the early stages as White's London structure exerts little influence on Black's side of the board. Black may therefore develop freely. Common options include:
A popular response to the London System at higher levels of play is an early ...c5, allowing ...Qb6 (aiming at White's weak b2-pawn, which is no longer defended by a bishop on c1). This seeks to disrupt White's comfortable development system. The line 1.d4 Nf6 2.Bf4 c5 3.e3 Qb6 was considered by Johnsen and Kovačević to be the most critical line.[10]
A modern development named after grandmastersRichárd RapportandBaadur Jobava, this system still has considerable surprise value. It combines Bf4 with Nc3 (this knight would usually be developed to d2 in the standard London System) creating potential threats against Black's c7.

## Matinovsky Gambit
# Content [from](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/matinovsky-gambit/)

The Matinovsky Gambit is an aggressive line by black in the Owen’s Defense. It starts with the moves:
1. e4 b62. d4 Bb73. Bd3 f5
Black looks to give up the f pawn in exchange for an activated light squared bishop. Black can immediately take on g2 and threaten the h1 rook. If white plays correctly the rook on h1 will stay safe and should have a very good game. White should always accept the gambit but must make sure they are familiar with the opening or things can turn quickly in black’s favor.
After the moves 4. exf5 Bxg2, white should continue with 5. Qh5+. Black is forced to play g6 followed by 6. fxg6. Now black has a couple of options.
6…Nf6
Black looks to get the knight involved in the game and attack the white queen. Unfortunately this loses the game for black. White can play:
7. gxh7+ Nxh58. Bg6#
6…Bg7
This is the only viable option for black but white still has the advantage. White now should play 7. gxh7+. Black is forced to move the King to f8.
It may be tempting for white to keep putting immediate pressure with 8. Qf5 or 8. hxg8=Q+ but white should instead play 8. Nf3. This is because it keeps black from capturing the rook on h1. Black would lose after 8…Bxh1 9. Ne5 Qe8 10. hxg8=Q+ Rxg8 11. Qf5+ Bf6 12. Bh6 Rg7 13. Bxg7 Kxg7 14. Qh7+ Kf8 15. Bg6.
The best option black has is to continue 8…Nf6 (attacking the queen) 9. Qg6 Bxf3 (Bxh1 would be a mistake after Bh6 for white) 10. Rg1.
While it may look dangerous for white to capture the pawn on f5 in the Matinovsky Gambit, it’s not a major threat if white knows how to respond correctly.

## Max Lange Attack
# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Lange_Attack)
TheMax Lange Attackis achess openingthat can arise from several different opening lines, including theTwo Knights Defense,Petroff's Defense,Scotch Gambit,Bishop's Opening,Center Game, andGiuoco Piano.[1]Two of the most commonly seenmove ordersare 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 (the Two Knights Defense) 4.d4 exd4 5.0-0 Bc5 6.e5, and 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Bc4 (the Scotch Gambit) Bc5 5.0-0 Nf6 6.e5.
The opening is named for the GermanmasterMax Lange, who suggested it in 1854.[2]
After 6.e5, Black has two main replies. Black's 6...Ng4 isplayable, but rarely seen. More common is 6...d5, when the main line continues 7.exf6 dxc4 8.Re1+ Be6 9.Ng5 Qd5 (9...Qxf6??10.Nxe6 fxe6 11.Qh5+ followed by 12.Qxc5 is a notorious trap) 10.Nc3 Qf5 (10...dxc3?? 11.Qxd5 wins, since 11...Bxd5 is illegal) 11.Nce4 0-0-0 with complex play. Another line for White to try, a critical response, is after 6...d5, White plays 7.Bb5 with strong ideas for both sides, usually resulting in a slight edge for White.
An alternative for White is 8.fxg7 Rg8 9.Bg5, analysed byLev Gutmanand Stefan Bücker inKaissiber, which they consider to be good for White.  Black's usual response is 9...Be7 10.Bxe7 Kxe7.

## Muzio Gambit
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/forum/view/chess-openings/kings-gambit-muzio-gambit)

I personally think that white has a good enough lead in development to compensate for the knight... But do they have a good enough one to win the game??
It is a very interesting opening. But interesting does not mean sound. No GM would ever dare play it as white. Not even at the master level. But below 1500, sure, why not?
It is a very interesting opening. But interesting does not mean sound. No GM would ever dare play it as white. Not even at the master level. But below 1500, sure, why not?
You are wrong, someone not only dared, but managed to win as well.
And this was not plain Muzio, but even wilder double Muzio:

You have a nice blog here:
http://blog.chess.com/Etienne/muzio-gambit-database

and another Muzio game:

British GM Raymond Keene used to play it at the GM level as well:

Thanks for the posts,@NarniacallsActually it is a gambit that should be played more by higher ranked players.
Dragoljub Minic is another GM who plays it:

Wow so many amazing openings...
Nikolay Tsarenkov is an International Master who plays the Muzio at the master level as well.

7 Nc3 offering the second piece is a great line also, perhaps not as strong as e5, though worth a try.
>:)
You can find a collection of Muzio games here:
http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chesscollection?cid=1006233
and here is a well played defence, so people wouldnt think that white always have an upper hand

I play the Muzio in bullet/blitz, and it's common for Black to be dazedly watching the train approaching but not knowing which way to turn to get off the track.
In GM annotations, the Muzio remains "unclear". Every now and then someone pulls out a prepared novelty when a win has big value, and they know that OTB their opponent hasn't the time to analyze fully. The King's Gambit isn't a settled issue, and I have found (and been victimized by) several refutations of GM analyses.
And to answer an original question, I would say that Muzio is dubious, it deserves "?!" mark in my book.
But, white scores surprisingly well with it.
365chess.com:
chessgames.com:

There is a reason why strong black players mostly prefer4...Bg7over4...g4,it is just too risky.

So, I would say that if you know your lines, and if you like tactical game, I think that Muzio is nice try at live chess and OTB.
In online chess it is probably best to avoid Muzio (and especially double Muzio), as black can use the books to steer the game into lines where black is substantially better.
I think black is best..
What about 6. ... Qh4!

Yeah, Qh4 threatens nothing and it only puts the queen in an awkward place, it's hardly likely to be a useful move.
White answers Qh4 with d4, freeing the Q-side B, and Black is even further behind in development.
You need to study up on theMuzioGambit to play it. If you don't know how to attack correctly after sacrificing the knight you will quickly be a piece down in the endgame.
The Muzio Gambit is very strong and gives white a slight advantage,
The reason modern day masters don't play it is because black is scared of the muzio and won't play g4!
I sure don't go into Muzio as Black any more on blitz time controls. The gambit is probably unsound but dangerous and you will be burning too much time on the clock while trying to find an adequate defense. If I had an opportunity to play against it in turn-based, I might try accepting. Anyway though the Black is fine with 4. ...Bg7

# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzio_Gambit)
In chess, theMuzio Gambit, sometimes called thePolerio Gambit, is anopeningline in theKing's Gambitin which White sacrifices a knight for a large lead indevelopmentandattackingchances. It begins with the moves:
White offers a knight, aiming to exploit Black's weakness on the f-file[1]to attack the black king. Other possibilities for White's 5th move are 5.Bxf7+ (Lolli Gambit), 5.Nc3 (McDonnell Gambit), 5.d4 (Ghulam Kassim Gambit), 5.h4 (Australian Gambit), and 5.Ne5 (Salvio Gambit), but 5.0-0! is generally reckoned to be White's strongest option,[2][3]and in fact 4.Bc4 (rather than 4.h4) is usually played with the intention of playing a Muzio. Black can avoid the Muzio with4...Bg7, and this has sometimes been recommended as a safe and practicalover-the-boardchoice.[4]
TheEncyclopaedia of Chess Openingsclassifies the Muzio Gambit under code C37.
The opening was originally analysed byGiulio Cesare Polerioin the late 16th century;[5]the first recorded game is by the Neapolitan player Geronimo Cascio inAlessandro Salvio'sIl Puttino, published in 1634.[6]The name "Muzio Gambit" originated with the early 19th-century English chess writerJacob Sarratt, who misattributed the opening to Cascio's contemporary Mutio d'Allesandro in his translation ofIl Puttino. In its original form, White used Italian-style freecastling, placing the king on h1 and rook on f1, for an even stronger attack sincechecksby a queen or bishop on the g1–a7 diagonal are no longer available as a defence.
The opening reached its peak popularity in the mid 19th century, theRomantic era of chess, whensacrificesand early attacks were considered the pinnacle of chess art. Its popularity declined with the improvements in defensive technique exemplified by players such asLouis PaulsenandWilhelm Steinitz; however, it is still occasionally seen, usually at amateur level.

## Nakhmanson Gambit

# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/forum/view/chess-openings/nakhmanson-gambit-1)
nakhmanson gmabit is here!!
I really like the Nakhmanson Gambit, as it's really easy to learn, and you just have so much potential. With perfect play by black, it is a draw though, but they have to play computer moves, and even Stockfish 12 can't beat/draw it! I recently made a video on this, and you can find it right over here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2n8TAR69EyY
with perfect play by black it is a draw?
After Nxc3 and d5, black has a safe advantage with no risk.
There are some reasons that almost no books mention it...
White has some compensations for the pawn, but really less than many other gambits...
Keep analyzing, or see the video, it's fine for white.
lol, just to be curious (and bcoz i have time to waste), let's go watching a video made by a kid, advocated here by a 1600...
I'm just interested in Nxc3 line, I don't want to go into trash and let's see what he proposes at about 10'30...
"This... (hesitation here) is gonna be a draw". He doesn't look so sure and well, with black playing easy moves (yes there are quite easy to find because natural), we are pawn up for almost no compensation for white.
All endgames a pawn down are draw? I have some doubts...
Gonna be a draw? Perhaps. If white just begins with pawn down, we can be sure he/she will not be able to defend accurately so far from a draw.
And that's all he says about Nxc3, lol. Less than 1 min about the line to play for black, with a ridiculous evaluation (he admits he would prefer black thought), when 14 min spent with trash lines that all players with black and some good sense would avoid.
Next stupid gambit?
Where does the nameNakhmanson came from? GM Sokolov played this in 1960's and Yakov Neishtadt commenting one of the games say that this move comes from GM Esteban Canal.
In factYakov Neishtadt classifies as 6.Nc3? the move played by Sokolov in 1966.
Isn’t dxc3 losing for black. I’m pretty sure that nxc3 gives black a easy edge, but maybe not winning.
Actually, in the Nxc3 line given above, I'm very surprised that stockfish just gives 0.00.

I don't know which Stockfish u use and how but mine gives almost -1 for black...
I used 12 on chessbase
Maybe 10... Bd6 or 10... Qd6 is an improvement. Or your 7... Be7 may be best. It doesn't matter anyways from an opening perspective since white is the one trying to equalize and he's already worst, but just to be as accurate as possible with black.
Nahkmanson is bad tho this is better
I like how Chess_Night5030 argues with an IM, and is using a worthless youtube video as a basis for an argument. The guy is hilarious.
Yes I think your right about Bd6 being better than f6 on move 12, White seems to be strugling to equalise. But, do you think that black could gain even a bigger edge with 10... Bd6 or 7... Be7.
I'm not sure how good my analysis is, but it seems like black's edge is pretty small in these lines. I'm inclined to believe that the most challenging moves (in 6... Nxc3) is rather 7... Be7 or 10... Bd6.
yup you are right
Well I'm not 100% sure about my analysis (I didn't use high depth stockfish), but I definitely changed my mind about dxc3, it's more complicated then thought and Nxc3 gives a decent edge in most lines.
Wow, a nice sharp gambit!
It might be better for black if you accept the knihgt sacrifice, but you have to found some difficult moves over the board, which is not that simple as you can slip very easily.

## Nimzo Indian Defense
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Nimzo-Indian-Defense)
The Nimzo-Indian Defense (often called "the Nimzo" for short) is considered one of Black's best responses to White's 1.d4 opener. Black often gives up the bishop pair, but in exchange receives the better pawn structure and easy development. Black will also try to keep the position closed, while White seeks to open up the center for the two bishops.
TheNimzo-Indian Defenseappears after the moves1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4. Black pins the white knight to the king, helping to control the e4 square.
White has tried several fourth moves against the Nimzo-Indian over the years. No fewer than nine of them have appeared at least 700 times in master play, and seven of them at least 1800 times. Two have become particularly popular, with over 25,000 appearances. No matter which of the top nine fourth moves White chooses, however, White wins only between 34 and 37% of games. No wonder the opening is considered so strong for Black.
Most variations revolve around two key, intertwined questions: Will Black exchange bishop for knight on c3, and if so, will White recapture with a piece or accept doubled pawns and retake with bxc3?
In the most common continuation, White begins to develop the kingside with4.e3, admitting that the pawn won't reach e4 any time soon. White has the option to play5.Ne2and recapture on c3 with the knight. If White is more concerned about development than pawn structure,5.Bd3will be played before the knight moves, giving Black an extra opportunityto double up White's pawns.
A key sub-variation of the Rubinstein is the Hubner variation, named for GMRobert Hubner, which reaches the position below after the moves 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3c5 5.Bd3 Nc6 6.Nf3 Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 d6.
Almost as popular as the Rubinstein, White immediately sidesteps the prospect of doubled pawns with4.Qc2in what is usually known as the Classical Variation, and sometimes the Capablanca Variation after the Cuban world champion,Jose Raul Capablanca. The intent of this move is best demonstrated by the most common continuation,4...O-O 5.a3 Bxc3 6.Qxc3.
In the aptly-named Three Knights, White plays the third knight move of the game (counting both sides) with4.Nf3. GM Garry Kasparov used it extensively to win the world championship from GM Anatoly Karpov in 1985, scoring +3 =3 in six tries during the match, with another win early in their 1986 rematch, and so it is sometimes referred to as the Kasparov Variation.
If Black makes the most popular reply,4...d5, the game has transposed into the Ragozin Variation of the Queen's Gambit.
In the Kmoch Variation,4.f3, White insists on trying to play the e-pawn two squares forward instead of one. The Kmoch usually transposes into a form of the Samisch (below) after the typical continuation4...d5(stopping 5.e4)5.a3.
The Samisch,4.a3by White, not only makes no effort to avoid doubled pawns, but actively encourages the continuation4...Bxc3 5.bxc3. It's not the most popular variation because White often loses the c4-pawn by force, and the move 4.a3 does nothing to help White's development or position in the center. However, the Samisch remains perhaps the most important variation in Nimzo-Indian opening theory, because it so forcefully creates the two bishops vs. doubled pawn dynamic.
GM Fabien Libiszewski covered the Samisch inthis Chess.com Lesson.
4.Bg5, the Leningrad, allows White to play e3 later without blocking in the dark-squared bishop.
4.g3, the Romanishin-Kasparov. White sometimes fianchettoes in the Three Knights, which was Kasparov's treatment in the mid-1980s, and 4.g3 can easily transpose to those variations.
4.Bd2has no unique name, but it is a playable, immediate way to avoid doubled pawns, albeit rather passive.
4.Qb3, the Spielmann Variation after Austrian masterRudolf Spielmann, has a similar idea to the Classical Variation, but4...c5for Black protects the bishop and engines already give Black a tiny edge.
Games that begin1.d4 Nf6are known as "Indian" openings. The origins regarding why are unclear, but CM Arne Mollwrote about them in 2018, and they can be traced back in part to an Indian player in the mid-19th century named Bannerjee Moheschunder. The other half of the name "Nimzo-Indian" comes fromAron Nimzowitsch, who was not the first master to play the opening, but perhaps the most important player in popularizing it.
When the 1920s began, the opening was still little-known, but by the end of the decade, it was one of Black's favored defenses to 1.d4. It first appeared in world championship play in the second game of the 1929 match betweenAlexander AlekhineandEfim Bogoljubovand has been played at least once in nearly every world championship since (although not since 2013, and extremely unlikely to be seen in 2021--challenger GMIan Nepomniachtchirarely plays 1.d4 as White and has played the Nimzo as Black exactly once, in a 2020 rapid game).
The opening has never lost its luster and remains a key weapon for Black to this day. After 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6, White plays3.Nf3more often than 3.Nc3 in part because of the strength of the Nimzo.
One of the most famous games of all time was played out of the Nimzo-Indian, with future world championMikhail Botvinnikdefeating former world champion Capablanca at the legendary AVRO tournament of 1938 (Moll, again,on that tournament here). Capablanca used his favorable queenside structure to win a pawn on that side of the board, but Botvinnik won the game thanks to his central pawns and a celebrated combination that started on move 30.
Black's most famous win was played by the namesake of the opening, Aron Nimzowitsch, in his contest against Paul Johner at Dresden in 1926. Nimzowitsch successfully bottled up Johner's bishops by closing the position, and his famous maneuver on moves 12-16 set up an eventual kingside attack that was decisive.
The Nimzo-Indian is one of Black's most popular responses to 1.d4. The pin on the c3 knight is hard for White to deal with and Black often gets good positions with pressure on White's center. Play around in theChess.com Explorerto see more variations.

TheNimzo-Indian Defenceis achess openingcharacterised by the moves:
Other move orders, such as 1.c4 e6 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.d4 Bb4, are also feasible. In theEncyclopaedia of Chess Openings, the Nimzo-Indian is classified as E20–E59.
Thishypermodernopening was developed byAron Nimzowitschwho introduced it to master-levelchessin the early 20th century. Unlike mostIndian openings, the Nimzo-Indian does not involve an immediatefianchetto, although Black often follows up with ...b6 and ...Bb7. By pinning White'sknight, Black prevents the threatened 4.e4 and seeks to inflictdoubled pawnson White. White will attempt to create apawn centreand develop their pieces to prepare for an assault on the Black position.
Black's delay in committing to apawn structuremakes the Nimzo-Indian (sometimes colloquially referred to as the "Nimzo") a very flexible defence to1.d4. It can also transpose into lines of theQueen's GambitorQueen's Indian Defence. The Nimzo-Indian is a highly respected defence to 1.d4, is played at all levels and has been played by every world champion sinceCapablanca. White often plays 3.g3 or 3.Nf3 to avoid the Nimzo-Indian, allowing them to meet 3.Nf3 Bb4+ (theBogo-Indian Defence) with 4.Bd2 or 4.Nbd2, rather than 4.Nc3.
In the Nimzo-Indian, Black is generally prepared to concede the bishop pair by playing Bxc3. As dynamic compensation, they often double White's c-pawns, which represent a static weakness, and gains play against the central light squares d5 and e4, even in those instances where White is able to recapture with a piece after ...Bxc3. By pinning the knight to the king, black indirectly controls the center by preventing the move e4. Black will aim to close the position to reduce the scope of White's bishops. To this end, Black must blockade the white pawn centre from advancing and neutralise White's attacking chances on thekingside. An example of Black's strategy carried out successfully is the gameMikhail Botvinnik–Samuel Reshevskyfrom the1948 World Chess Championship,[1]which reached the position in the diagram after White's 24th move.
Earlier in the game, Reshevsky was able to block White's kingside attack by playing ...Nf6–e8 and ...f7–f5. Now, both White's bishops are reduced to defence, and White's queen is reduced to passivity at the a2-square to defend the pawns on a3 and c4. Without prospects for counterplay, White's game is strategically hopeless, and Black ultimately exchanged queens and won theendgame.
TheRubinstein System(named afterAkiba Rubinstein) is White's most common method of combating the Nimzo-Indian.Svetozar GligorićandLajos Portischmade great contributions to the theory and practice of this line at top level during their careers. White continues their development before committing to a definite plan of action. In reply, Black has three main moves to choose from: 4...0-0, 4...c5, and 4...b6.
In addition, Black sometimes plays 4...d5 or 4...Nc6. The move 4...d5 can transpose to lines arising from 4...0-0, but White has the extra option of 5.a3 (known as theBotvinnik Variation). This forces Black to retreat the bishop to e7 or capture on c3, which transposes to a line of the Sämisch Variation long considered good for White because they will undouble their pawns at some point by playing cxd5, eliminating the weak pawn on c4, then prepare the e4 pawn break, backed by the bishop pair (and in some cases with f3, since they haven't committed the knight to that square yet), which will gain force in the more open type of position which will ensue. 4...Nc6 is theTaimanov Variation, named after Russian GMMark Taimanov. Black prepares to play ...e5, which may be preceded by...d5 and ...dxc4, or ...d6. The variation was tried several times by the youngBobby Fischer, and has long been favoured by GMNukhim Rashkovsky.
Black's most flexible and frequently played response is 4...0-0. The main line continues 5.Bd3 d5 6.Nf3 c5 7.0-0, reaching the position in the diagram.
White has completed their kingside development, while Black has claimed their share of the centre. At this point, the most important continuations are:
After 7...dxc4 8.Bxc4,  Black also has two rare alternatives on their eighth move worth mentioning: 8...Qe7 intending ...Rd8 is theSmyslov Variation, invented by former world championVasily Smyslov, and  8...Bd7 followed by ...Bc6  is theBronstein Variation, the brainchild of two-time world championship finalistDavid Bronstein.
In general, the main line of the Rubinstein has held up very well for Black, so since the 1980s White has begun to look elsewhere for chances of obtaining an advantage. In the Rubinstein, White has often resorted to playing Ne2 rather than Nf3 at some point to be able to recapture on c3 with the knight, thus avoiding the doubled pawns. Two lines where White does this (following 4.e3 0-0) are:
Black puts pressure on d4 and leaves open the option of playing ...d5, or ...d6 and ...e5. The game can still transpose to the main line mentioned above after moves such as 5.Bd3 d5 6.Nf3 0-0 7.0-0, but there are two major variations particular to 4...c5:
Favoured by Nimzowitsch, 4...b6 is a move in accordance with the spirit of the Nimzo-Indian: Blackfianchettoestheir light-squared bishop to increase their control over e4. White usually continues 5.Ne2, avoiding the doubled pawns, or 5.Bd3, continuing their development (5.Nf3 usually transposes to 5.Bd3). The main variations emerging from these moves are:
TheClassicalorCapablanca Variationwas popular in the early days of the Nimzo-Indian, and though eventually superseded by 4.e3 it was revived in the 1990s; it is now just as popular as the Rubinstein. White aims to acquire the two bishops without compromising their pawn structure. The drawback is that the queen will move at least twice within the opening moves and that White's kingside development is delayed. Thus, even though White possesses the bishop pair, it is usually advisable for Black to open the game quickly to exploit their lead in development. Black has four common replies to 4.Qc2. These include 4...0-0, 4...c5, 4...d5, and 4...Nc6  (4...d6 intending ...Nbd7 and ...e5 is a rarer fifth option).
4.Nf3 is known as theKasparov Variation, sinceGarry Kasparovused it to great effect againstAnatoly Karpovin their 1985 World Championship match. Kasparov played 4.Nf3 six times, scoring three wins and three draws.[5]Today as White, this is a favourite weapon of GMAlexei Barsovand former Women's ChampionNona Gaprindashvili. It is also sometimes known as the purely descriptiveThree Knights Variation.
White develops the knight to a natural square and waits to see Black's reply. 4...d5 transposes to the Ragozin Defence of the Queen's Gambit Declined and 4...b6 5.Bg5 Bb7 transposes to the Nimzo/Queen's Indian hybrid line, so 4...c5 is the most common move that stays within Nimzo-Indian territory. Now 5.e3 transposes to the Rubinstein System, but the main move is 5.g3, which leads to a position that also arises from the Fianchetto Variation. 5.g3 cxd4 6.Nxd4 0-0 7.Bg2 d5 8.cxd5 Nxd5 can be considered the main line. Black has dissolved White's centre, but the bishop on g2 exerts pressure on the black queenside, which White may augment with 9.Qb3.
This line can also arise from theBogo-Indian Defence(1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 Bb4+) if White blocks the check with 4.Nc3.[6]
In theEncyclopaedia of Chess Openings, the Nimzo-Indian Defence has codes E20 to E59. All codes begin with 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4, excluding E20, which also includes alternatives to 3...Bb4 apart from 3...d5 (which would be theQueen's Gambit Declined).

# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimzowitsch_Defence)
TheNimzowitsch Defence(named afterAron Nimzowitsch) is a somewhat unusualchess openingcharacterised by the moves:
This opening is an example of ahypermodernopening in which Black invites White to occupy thecentreof the board at an early stage with pawns.[1]Black's intent is to block or otherwise restrain White's central pawns and, if allowed to do so by inaccurate play by White, eventually undermine the White pawn centre by well-timed pawn advances of their own or by attacking the white pieces defending the centre.World ChampionGarry KasparovandGrandmasterRaymond Keenewrote that it "has never been fully accepted as a dependable opening. Nevertheless it is sound and offers the maverick spirit a great deal of foreign territory to explore."[2]
The Nimzowitsch is included under code B00 in theEncyclopaedia of Chess Openings.
White takes the initiative in the centre. Black's main continuations are 2...d5 or 2...e5.
The line thatAron Nimzowitsch, the originator of the opening, usually preferred.  Now White can choose among:
Asolidline favoured by the late British grandmasterTony Miles.  White cantransposeto theScotch Gamewith 3.Nf3, or play 3.d5 Nce7 (with the intentions of 4. -- Ng6 - Black Knight's Tango) (3...Nb8, although perhaps not as bad as it looks, is considered inferior), which gives White only a slight plus score in practice. Another approach is 3.dxe5 Nxe5, when White can seek a quietpositionaladvantage with 4.Nf3 or play the more aggressive (but potentially weakening) thrust 4.f4.
Shown by some databases to be themost common move, 2.Nf3 is often played by White players not eager for a theoretical battle on their opponent's turf.[3]

## Petrov Defense
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Petrovs-Defense)
Petrov's Defense (also spelled Petroff and alternatively called the Russian Game, Petrov Defense, or simply the Petrov) is one of Black's most solid options against 1.e4. On move two,Black responds to an attack on the e5 pawn by counterattacking the pawn on e4 with the knight. This often leads to a trade of pawns on the e-file.
Although often considered a drawish opening for this reason among others, in the last several years players like GMFabiano Caruanahave shown it to have much more bite than previously thought. That said, it remains a less dynamic opening than many others.
Petrov's Defense begins1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6. The main independent lines of the Petrov are3.Nxe5and3.d4. Also possible on move three is3.Nc3, which transposes into theFour Knights Game.
The Petrov almost always continues3...d6 4.Nf3 Nxe4at which point White has two main options.
The older and still most common continuation is5.d4 d5 6.Bd3at which point Black has several options:6...Be7,6...Bd6,6...Nc6are most common. Both sides develop quickly and strategic play usually ensues.
In recent years, White has started playing5.Nc3on move five, welcoming doubled pawns in exchange for quick development after5...Nxc3 6.dxc3. White usually castles queenside while Black, after the best and most common follow-up,6...Be7, can either castle short or wait in the center and develop the queenside.
Black can blunder in this line if not careful, and no less than GMViswanathan Ananddid so in 1988 by, instead of taking the knight on c3, going for5...Bf5 6.Qe2, at which point he resigned because6...Qe7 7.Nd5loses at least a piece for Black.
It is tempting for less experienced players to try to retain symmetry with3...Nxe4instead of 3...d6, but this move loses at least a pawn, and often more than that if Black isn't careful.
A sideline of Petrov's Defense that has become popular in online blitz in recent times is the Stafford Gambit, which is3...Nc6on move three. More information on the Stafford is availablehere.
5.Qe2is another playable fifth move for White, but it leads to a draw in four out of every five master-level games. In most situations White is playing for some kind of advantage in the opening, which this move does not achieve, but if White only needs a draw the move can be useful.
Petrov's Defense is named for the 19th century Russian master Alexander Petrov, although it was a known opening well before his time, appearing in the work ofPedro Damianoaround the year 1500.
The move 2...Nf6 was long used as a drawing weapon when the player with the black pieces did not want to face the complexities that follow 2...Nc6. Although generally considered a respectable opening, it did not appear in a world chess championship until 1969 when GMTigran Petrosianmade a couple quick draws with it in a match he eventually lost to GMBoris Spassky.
About 50 years later, Caruana used it all three times he faced 1.e4 as Black in the2018 Candidates, and all three games were decisive including two wins. Caruana has also shown how White can beat the Petrov, as GMGreg Serperexplained inthis 2019 piece. Unless White is happy with a draw before the game even begins, the Petrov is nonetheless a strong opening for Black.

# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrov%27s_Defence)
Petrov's Defenceor thePetrov Defence(also calledPetroff Defence,Petrov's Game,Russian Defence, orRussian Game–Russian:Русская партия) is achess openingcharacterised by the following moves:
Though thissymmetricalresponse has a long history, it was first popularised byAlexander Petrov, aRussianchessplayer in the mid-19th century. In recognition of the early investigations by the Russian masters Petrov andCarl Jaenisch, this opening is called the Russian Game in some countries.
The Petrov has a drawish reputation; however, it offers attacking opportunities for both sides, and a few lines are quitesharp. Often a trade occurs and Black, after gaining atempo, has a well-placedknight.Pillsbury's game in 1895[1]againstEmanuel Laskertestifies to this. The Black counterattack in thecentrealso avoids theRuy Lopez,Giuoco Piano(and other lines of theItalian Game), and theScotch Game. The Petrov has been adopted by many of the world's leading players, including world championsVasily Smyslov,Tigran Petrosian,Anatoly Karpov, andVladimir Kramnik, along withgrandmasterFabiano Caruanaand others.
TheEncyclopaedia of Chess Openingscodes for Petrov's Defence are C43 (for 3.d4) and C42 (for all other lines).[2]
White's two main choices for move three are 3.Nxe5, theClassical Variationand 3.d4, theSteinitz Variation. 3.Nxe5 is more popular but they often lead to similar positions and "there is no clear reason to prefer one move over the other".[3]
3.Nc3 maytransposeto theFour Knights Gameor theThree Knights Game. 3.Bc4 may lead to theBoden–Kieseritzky Gambitor transpose to theTwo Knights Defence. Occasionally seen is thequiet3.d3.
After 3.Nxe5, the Classical Variation, by far the most popular move for Black is 3...d6. Black should not continue to copy White's moves with 3...Nxe4?!. After 4.Qe2 Black cannot play 4...Nf6??because 5.Nc6+ wins thequeen, and after 4...d5?! 5.d3 Qe7 6.dxe4 Qxe5 7.exd5 Black loses apawn.
Another common mistake is 4...d6, where after 5.Nxf7!Kxf7 6.Qxe4, Black has lost a pawn and the ability to castle.
Relatively best for Black is 4...Qe7 5.Qxe4 d6 6.d4 dxe5 7.dxe5 Nc6, and after for example 8.Nc3 (8.Bb5 is also good) 8...Qxe5 9.Qxe5+ Nxe5 10.Nb5 (or 10.Bf4) White has a clear advantage.[4][5]Also inferior for Black is 3...Qe7?! when 4.d4 d6 5.Nf3 Qxe4+ 6.Be2 gives White a large lead in development.
Most often, White follows the main line 3...d6 4.Nf3 Nxe4 5.d4 (5.Bd3!?is also playable, known as theMillennium Attack) d5 6.Bd3, where he will try to drive Black's advanced knight from e4 with moves like c4 and Re1. If White achieves this, then he is up two tempi (Nf6–e4–f6, plus the tempo White starts the game with). In practice White is usually able to achieve this, but at some structural cost such as having to play c4, which balances out.[6]White can also force simplification withLasker's 5.Qe2 Qe7 6.d3.  This is generally only good enough for adraw, which Black should be satisfied with.  Another possibility, explored byKeres, is 5.c4, known as theKauffmann Attack.
A completely different approach is to meet 4...Nxe4 with 5.Nc3 Nxc3 6.dxc3 with rapiddevelopmentandqueensidecastling. For instance, White can plan a quick Be3, Qd2, and 0-0-0, and play for akingsideattack, trusting that hisdoubledc-pawns will help protect his king, and that hisinitiativeand attacking potential will offset the longterm disadvantage of having doubled pawns. In the 5.Nc3 line, Black must avoid 5...Bf5?? 6.Qe2! which wins a piece due to thepin(if 6...Qe7 7.Nd5, forcing 7...Qd7 because of the threat to the c7-pawn; then 8.d3 wins the piece).Viswanathan Anandresigned after only six moves after falling for this againstAlonso Zapataat Biel in 1988.[7]
TheCochrane Gambit, 4.Nxf7, is labelled "speculative but entertaining" byNick de FirmianinModern Chess Openings(MCO) 14th edition. He evaluates the position inVeselin Topalov–Vladimir Kramnik,Linares 1999as offering chances for both sides after 4...Kxf7 5.Nc3 c5!? 6.Bc4+ Be6 7.Bxe6+ Kxe6 8.d4 Kf7 9.dxc5 Nc6.[8]
ThePaulsen Variation, 4.Nc4, is labelled "ineffective" by de Firmian inMCO, but is occasionally seen at grandmaster level. US master Andrew Karklins has experimented with 4.Nd3!?, now called theKarklins–Martinovsky Variation. This was played in theWorld Chess Championship 2018betweenMagnus CarlsenandFabiano Caruana.[9]
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nxe5 Nc6?!, recently dubbed theStafford Gambit, is considered dubious, but it sets a number oftraps, and in the early 2020s it became popular in online blitz and bullet games. After 4.Nxc6 dxc6, White wins a pawn but must play carefully. After 5.e5 (5.d3 is better) Ne4 6.d3?? (White should play 6.Nc3, 6.d4, or 6.Qe2) 6...Bc5! and White resigned in Lowens–Stafford, US correspondence game 1950.[10][11]After 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nxe5 Nc6 4.Nxc6 dxc6 5.d3 Bc5, White must avoid theLégal Trap6.Bg5?? Nxe4!, and if 7.Bxd8 (relatively best but still losing is 7.Be3) 7...Bxf2+ 8. Ke2 Bg4#. Instead White should play 6.Be2 Bc5 7.c3! with d3-d4 to follow, and Black has insufficient compensation for the pawn, though White must still play carefully.[12]

3.d4 was favoured byWilhelm Steinitz, and is sometimes called the Steinitz Variation, although it was known earlier. Black can capture either pawn; also possible is 3...d6, transposing into thePhilidor Defence.
After 3...exd4 4.e5 (4.Bc4 transposes into theUrusov Gambit) 4...Ne4 (4...Qe7?! 5.Be2 is better for White) 5.Qxd4 d5 6.exd6 Nxd6 7.Nc3 Nc6 8.Qf4 the game is approximatelyequal. After the other capture, 3...Nxe4, 4.Bd3 d5 (4...Nc6!? 5.Bxe4 d5, intending 6.Bd3 e4, is also possible) 5.Nxe5, when either 5...Nd7 or 5...Bd6 gives roughly equal chances.
A long and complicated tactical sequence which has frequently been seen in master games is 3...Nxe4 4.Bd3 d5 5.Nxe5 Bd6 6.0-0 0-0 7.c4 Bxe5 8.dxe5 Nc6 9.cxd5 Qxd5 10.Qc2 Nb4 11.Bxe4 Nxc2 12.Bxd5 Bf5 13.g4 Bxg4 14.Be4 Nxa1 15.Bf4 f5 16.Bd5+ Kh8 17.Rc1 c6 18.Bg2 Rfd8 19.Nd2 (diagram) and White has the slightly better endgame after either 19...Rxd2 20.Bxd2 Rd8 21.Bc3 Rd1+ 22.Rxd1 Bxd1 or 19...h6 20.h4.[13][14]
3.Nc3 is the Three Knights Game of Petrov's Defence. It can also be reached via 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.Nf3 (theVienna Game). Commonly, after 3...Nc6, the opening transposes to theFour Knights Game. With the reply 3...Bb4 (or some others), it remains the Three Knights Game proper.
3.Bc4 is the Italian Variation of Petrov's Defence. With 3...Nc6, it transposes to theTwo Knights Defence.
Another possibility is 3.Bc4 Nxe4 4.Nc3, the Boden–Kieseritzky Gambit. It is not considered wholly sound, since Black has several viable options. Black can accept the gambit with 4...Nxc3 5.dxc3 f6, but must play carefully after 6.0-0 (for example 6...Bc5?? 7.Nxe5! is disastrous; 6...d6 and 6...Nc6 are good). Another more aggressive try is 6.Nh4, where White goes for a quick assault on Black's king, but Black can maintain a small advantage if he plays cautiously via 6...g6 7.f4 Qe7 8.f5 Qg7 9.Qg4 Kd8.  Another possibility is returning the gambit pawn with 4...Nxc3 5.dxc3 c6 6.Nxe5 d5, which equalises. A third possibility is transposing to theItalian Four Knights Gamewith 4...Nc6, and if 5.Nxe4, 5...d5. If 5.Bxf7+?, then 5...Kxf7 6.Nxe4 d5 gives Black thebishop pairand control of thecentre. If 5.0-0, Black plays 5...Nxc3 6.dxc3 and now Black can play 6...Qe7!, after whichBobby Fischerwrote that "White has no compensation for the Pawn",[15]or 6...f6 transposing to the main line of the Boden–Kieseritzky. Black also has lines beginning 6...Be7 and 6...h6.

## Philidor Defense
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Philidor-Defense)
ThePhilidor Defenseis a passive but playable opening for Black, usually reached by the move order1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6. It is named after the 18th century French masterFrancois Philidor, who preferred 2...d6 to the more common alternative (then and now) of 2...Nc6.
The Philidor is defined by Black's second move, 2...d6. Although it is the third-most common move in the position, it is only played about 1/30th as often as 2...Nc6 and 1/3 as often as the Petroff Defense (2...Nf6). At the same time it is 10 times more popular than the #4 move, the Latvian Gambit (2...f5).
If you watch GMBenjamin Finegold's Chess.comLessons on the Philidor, he also teaches thealternative move order1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 e5.
White has two main responses to the Philidor, 3.d4 and 3.Bc4. Black generally responds to the first of those moves in one of three ways, not including Philidor's own move 3...f5, which is considered inferior today.
More than half of Philidor Defense games end up in this position, given the popularity of both 3.d4 and 3...exd4. After the typical continuation 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 Be7, White has several responses.
Nf6 is a typical move in any Philidor variation but can be played as early as move three, and is in fact the second most common try. Black's has its best results of any Philidor line if White plays the typical reply 4.Nc3, but White does very well playing 4.dxe5 instead.
3...Nd7 is the typical opening move of the Hanham Variation, which also includes the moves ...c6 and ...Be7. Black aims to develop naturally while controlling some central squares.
White can play 3.Bc4 to develop naturally while avoiding Black's main lines. Black must be careful not to end up in a trap known as Legal's Mate.
Against the Exchange Variation, 6.g3 and 6.Bf4 (win rate of 49% and 52%, respectively) score much better than 6.Be2 or 6.Bc4 (36% each). Against 3...Nf6 there is the 4.dxe5 line shown above for a 58% win rate for White. And the Hanham tends to do poorly against standard moves as below.
Although it wins at a slightly lower percentage than 3.d4, 3.Bc4 is seen far less often and so can have surprise value.
The Philidor Defense predates its namesake, with oneRuy Lopez de Seguragame on record as well as appearing four times in the writings ofGioachino Greco. Philidor analyzed and recommended it in his 1749 treatiseL’Analyse du jeu des Echecs. There are only a handful of records of Philidor playing the opening, but most of his games were not written down and lost to time.
The Philidor has had very few regular practitioners over the years. No world champions exceptAlexander Alekhinehave played it more than a handful of times, and sometimes seemingly by accident, such as when GMGarry Kasparovarrived in a Philidor position in 1979 by the move order 1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5 d6 3.Nc3 Nbd7 4.e4 e5. GMEtienne Bacrotis probably the best player to have used it somewhat often, making it part of his opening repertoire from 2003-05.
By far the most famous game in the Philidor Defense was a crushing defeat for Black against the star AmericanPaul Morphyin the famousOpera Game. However, Black's problems did not begin with the second move but rather the third, the weak 3...Bg4.
A young Alekhine showed how to win with the Philidor against careless play by White.
Although generally not recommended for high level players, the Philidor Defense is good for those who want to avoid main lines of the extensive theory that exists in the Ruy Lopez or Petroff. Visit theChess.com Explorerto play around with lines and move orders.

ThePhilidor Defence(orPhilidor's Defence) is achess openingcharacterised by the moves:
The opening is named after the famous 18th-century playerFrançois-André Danican Philidor, who advocated it as an alternative to the common 2...Nc6. His original idea was to challenge White'scentreby the pawn thrust ...f7–f5.
Today, the Philidor is known as asolidbut passive choice for Black, and is seldom seen in top-level play except as an alternative to the heavily analysed openings that can ensue after the normal 2...Nc6. It is considered a good opening for amateur players who seek a defensive strategy that is simpler and easier to understand than the complex positions that result from an opening such as theFrench Defence.
TheEncyclopaedia of Chess Openingscode for Philidor Defence is C41.
In his 1561 book,Ruy Lopez, seeking to debunkPedro Damiano, advocated 2...d6 as superior to 2...Nc6, on the grounds that 2...Nc6 allows the strong move 3.Bb5, now known as theRuy Lopezor Spanish Opening. Philidor evidently concurred with this assessment, though he also considered 2.Nf3 inferior to 2.Bc4. Philidor advocated the risky continuation 3.d4 f5!? The Philidor Defence subsequently became a popular opening, though 2...Nc6 remained the most common reply.
The Philidor occurred in one of the most famous games ever played,"The Opera Game"played in 1858 between the Americanchess masterPaul Morphyand two strong amateurs, the German nobleDuke Karl of Brunswickand the French aristocrat Count Isouard. The game continued 3.d4 Bg4, a deviation from modern standard lines. The Philidor Defence declined in popularity aspositional playbecame more developed, and it had almost completely vanished from top-tier chess byWorld War I.
As of 2017[update], there are no top players who employ the Philidor with regularity, althoughÉtienne BacrotandLiviu-Dieter Nisipeanuhave occasionally experimented with it in classical play. Its popularity in master play has increased slightly, however, over the last 20 years. It has also become fairly popular inrapid,blitz, andbullet chess.[1]
With 3.d4, White immediately challenges Black in thecentre. Black has several options.
The most common Black response is 3...exd4 which relieves the centraltension, although it gives up the centre. After 4.Nxd4 Nf6 (4...d5 5.exd5, thePaulsenAttack,[2]continues 5...Qxd5 6.Qe2+ Be7 7.Nb5 Na6 8.N1c3+/=Paulsen[3]) 5.Nc3, Black normally continues ...Be7 and ...0-0 (theAntoshin Variation) and achieves a strong defensive position. A sample line is: 5...Be7 6.Bc4 0-0 7.0-0 c5, and the position isequal.
In this line Black can alsofianchettohis bishop to g7, although this is uncommon.Bent Larsentried this in a few games, including adrawagainstMikhail Talin 1969.[4]
Instead of 4.Nxd4, White can play 4.Qxd4, as Paul Morphy favoured, intending 4...Nc6 5.Bb5 Bd7 6.Bxc6 Bxc6 7.Nc3 Nf6 8.Bg5 followed by 0-0-0. This line was played in many 19th-century games.
The other main option for Black is to maintain the central tension and adopt a setup with ...Nd7, ...Be7, and ...c6. This plan is named the Hanham Variation (after theAmericanchess masterJames Moore Hanham) and was favoured byAron Nimzowitsch. A common line is: 3...Nf6 4.Nc3 Nbd7 5.Bc4 Be7 6.0-0 (6.Ng5 is an interesting alternative: after 6...0-0 7.Bxf7+ Rxf7 8.Ne6 Qe8 9.Nxc7 Qd8 10.Nxa8, White is upmaterial, but Black can develop a stronginitiativeafter, for example, 10...b5 11.Nxb5 Qa5+) 6...0-0 7.a4 (to prevent ...b5) c6 (see diagram).
Grandmaster(GM)Larry Kaufmannotes that the Hanham Variation aims to maintain Black's pawn on e5, analogously to closed lines of theRuy Lopez, and opines that "it would be quite popular and on a par with the major defences to 1.e4, except for the annoying detail that Black can't actually reach the Hanham position by force."[5]
As an alternative to 4.Nc3 in response to Black's 3...Nf6, according to both Kaufman and GMChristian Bauer, White retains some advantage with: 4.dxe5!Nxe4 5.Qd5! (theRellstabVariation;[6]5.Nbd2 is theSokolskyVariation[7]) 5...Nc5 6.Bg5 Be7 7.exd6 Qxd6 8.Nc3.[8][9]
Black sometimes tries 3...Nd7 intending 4.Nc3 Ngf6, reaching the Hanham Variation. But then 4.Bc4! is awkward for Black to meet, since 4...Ngf6 loses to 5.dxe5 Nxe5 (5...dxe5??6.Ng5! wins) 6.Nxe5 dxe5 7.Bxf7+ Kxf7 8.Qxd8 Bb4+ 9.Qd2 Bxd2+ 10.Nxd2 winning a pawn, and 4...Be7 loses a pawn to 5.dxe5 Nxe5 (5...dxe5?? 6.Qd5! wins) 6.Nxe5 dxe5 7.Qh5![8][10]So 4...c6 is best for Black, but leaves White with the advantage of thebishop pairafter 5.0-0 Be7 6.dxe5 dxe5 (6...Nxe5 loses a pawn to 7.Nxe5 dxe5 8.Qh5) 7.Ng5! Bxg5 8.Qh5! Qe7 and now 9.Bxg5 or 9.Qxg5.[11]
In recent years, Black has experimented with othermove ordersin an attempt to reach the Hanham Variation while avoiding 3...Nf6 4.dxe5! and 3...Nd7 4.Bc4!
A more aggressive approach for Black after 3.d4 is 3...f5!?(diagram), Philidor's original intention and recommendation. In the 19th century, 3...f5 was also played byPaul Morphy. The move can lead to moreopen positionsthan the other lines, but is often considered dubious.[16][17]Others maintain that 3...f5 is a valid idea. GMTony Kostenconsiders the move respectable in his monograph on the opening.[18]The move was also played byDavid Bronsteinand byTeimour Radjabov.
After 3...f5 White has several ways to proceed:
Inferior is 3...Bg4?!, in light of 4.dxe5 Bxf3 (Black cannot recapture since 4...dxe5?5.Qxd8+ Kxd8 6.Nxe5 wins a clean pawn; or, Black can gambit a pawn with 4...Nd7, theAlbinVariation[34]) 5.Qxf3 (or White can obtain an endgame advantage with 5.gxf3 dxe5 6.Qxd8+ Kxd8 7.f4+/−Maróczy[35]) 5...dxe5 6.Bc4 giving White the advantage of thebishop pairin an open position as well as a largedevelopmentadvantage. Black cannot block the attack on the f7-pawn with the "natural" 6...Nf6? because White wins a pawn with 7.Qb3 (played in the famous "Opera Game", where Morphy as White refrained from taking the b7-pawn and retained a stronginitiativeafter 7...Qe7 8.Nc3). Black does better with 6...Qf6 7.Qb3 Bc5 8.0-0 Bb6 9.a4 a5 10.Nc3 Ne7 11.Be3 Nd7 12.Rad1+/−, or 6...Qd7!? (Maróczy).[35]
An alternative approach for White is 3.Bc4, delaying d2–d4, or forgoing it entirely, playing d2–d3 instead. The move 3.Bc4 is also White's route to a possibleLégal Trap. Some continuations:
Against the alternative 3.c3, Black can try 3...f5 (3...Nc6 4.d4 Nf6 transposes to thePonziani Opening) 4.exf5 Bxf5 5.Qb3 Nf6 6.Ng5 d5 7.Qxb7 Nbd7 8.Qc6 Bd6 withcompensationandinitiative.[38]

## Pirc Defense
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Pirc-Defense)
The Pirc Defense is a hypermodern way for Black to respond to White's 1.e4. Relatively new, the Pirc revolves around a quick kingside fianchetto by black. Strong players such as GMsVladimir KramnikandShakhriyar Mamedyarovfrequently use the Pirc to fight for a win.
Although players of all levels can play the Pirc, beginners should be careful when employing this opening. As with other hypermodern openings, White can use their central control and space advantage to roll over the unprepared Black player.
The Pirc Defense (pronounced "peerts") starts after the moves1.e4 d6. Instead of immediately occupying the center with another pawn, Black intends to control the center from a distance. Black eventually fianchettoes their dark-squared bishop on g7.
Black allows White to push their central pawns with the idea to chip away at them later. They usually achieve this by using their g7-bishop in conjunction with either ...e5 or ...c5, intensifying their control over the central dark squares.
ThePirc Defenseis relatively new and not as heavy on theory as other classical openings. Below you can see the main variations of the Pirc, mainly dictated by White's setup.
The main line of the Pirc goes1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6. Black allows White to expand in the center, hoping to counterattack it later. The fianchettoed bishop on g7 and an eventual pawn break with ...e5 or ...c5 is a common strategy of this opening, as well as queenside expansion with either ...a6/c6 and ...b5.
The Austrian Attack is the most aggressive way for White to respond to the Pirc. After the moves1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.f4, White immediately grabs more central space. White's idea is to develop their pieces and start an attack by playing e4-e5. Black, on the other hand, will try to prove that the white pawns are overextended.
The Classical System occurs after the moves1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Nf3. White goes for a less ambitious setup, developing their pieces and accepting a less robust control over the center. In this setup, it's harder for Black to generate counterplay against their opponent's center. However, it's also harder for White to win the game if Black defends accurately.
The 150 Attack starts after1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be3. White's idea is to place their queen on d2 to create a battery and exchange dark-squared bishops. After exchanging bishops, White proceeds to try to explore the weak dark squares on Black's kingside.
This variation receives the name 150 Attack because British players who analyzed the position concluded that this variation is very straightforward. They considered it so easy to play that any reasonable club player with a 150ECFgrade (approximately 1800 Elo rating) could have a good game against a grandmaster using this variation.
The Byrne Variation starts after1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Bg5and is similar to the Austrian Attack. White develops the dark-squared bishop before playing the f2-f4 pawn push. White can then create a queen-and-bishop battery to contest the black g7-bishop like in the 150 Attack or develop the other proceed with a central pawn break.
The Sveshnikov System occurs after1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.g3. White chooses a more positional approach, with the idea of reinforcing their central control by putting the light-squared bishop on the long diagonal and usually developing their king's knight to e2 instead of f3.
Although there are records of players employing the Pirc as early as the mid-1800s, it only caught up around the 1950s. It was then that the Slovenian (at the time Yugoslav) grandmaster Vasja Pirc, the opening's namesake, helped popularize it.
Before that, chess Classicists used to consider occupying the center as the only viable way of playing. It was only after the 1920s that players such asAron Nimzowitsch,Richard Reti,Efim Bogoljubov, and other leading players of the time introduced the concept of hypermodern chess.
According to them, a player doesn't have to occupy the center with pieces to control it. Instead, they can induce their opponent to overextend their central pawns and attack the weaknesses generated from a distance.
As hypermodernism grew in acceptance, so did all the hypermodern openings such as the Pirc, King's Indian Defense, Queen's Indian Defense, Nimzo-Indian Defense, and others. The opening peaked in popularity during the 1970s and is still occasionally seen in elite-level games.

ThePirc Defence(/ˈpɪərts/PEERTS) is achess openingcharacterised by the response of Black to 1.e4 with 1...d6 and 2...Nf6, followed by ...g6 and ...Bg7, while allowing White to establish acentrewith pawns on d4 and e4. It is named after the Slovenian grandmasterVasja Pirc.
The Pirc Defence is usually defined by the opening sequence
This is the most commonly played line after Black responds to 1.e4 with 1...d6.[2]It has been claimed to give rise to somewhat interesting and exciting games,[3]where Black will havecounterplaybut has to be cautious about playing too passively.[4]According toGarry Kasparov, the Pirc Defence is "hardly worth using in the tournaments of the highest category", as it gives White "too many opportunities for anybody's liking".[5]
The Pirc Defence, named after Slovenian grandmasterVasja Pirc, is a relatively new opening; while it was seen on occasion in the late nineteenth century, it was consideredirregular, thus remaining a sideline. The opening began gaining some popularity only afterWorld War II, and by the 1960s it was regarded asplayable, owing in large part to the efforts of Canadian grandmasterDuncan Suttles. Black, inhypermodernfashion, does not immediately stake a claim in the centre withpawns; rather, Black works to undermine White's centre from theflanks. Its first appearance in a World Championship match was in 1972, when it was played byBobby FischeragainstBoris Spasskyat Reykjavík (game 17); the game ended in adraw.
Hooper and Whyld gave a distinct formal definition, 1.d4 d6 2.e4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6, permuting White's first two moves, although they qualified the definition by remarking that 1.e4 d6 could alsotransposeto the Pirc.[6]The presence or absence of Black's third move in the Pirc is reported differently, according to the source;[7]with the pawn move 3...g6, Black prepares tofianchettothe king's bishop to g7.  Paul van der Sterren therefore described 3...g6 as "the defining move of the Pirc Defence" because the development of the bishop to g7 "creates the same sort of positional tension as theKing's Indian Defence".[8]
A distinction is usually drawn between the Pirc and lines where Black delays the development of his knight to f6, or omits it altogether; this is known as theModern or Robatsch Defence.  The tenth edition ofModern Chess Openings(1965) grouped the Pirc and Robatsch together as the "Pirc–Robatsch Defense".
The Austrian Attack begins 1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.f4 Bg7 5.Nf3, and was a favourite of Fischer. It is also well respected byNick de Firmian, the author ofModern Chess Openings(MCO). In placing pawns on d4, e4 and f4, White establishes a powerful centre, intending to push in the centre and/or attack on thekingside; in the main line, Black will usually counter with ...e5, aiming for play against the dark squares and weaknesses created by White's central advance. This direct, aggressive line is one of the most ambitious systems against the Pirc.Jan Timmanhas played the Austrian successfully with both colours.Yuri Balashovdoes well with the white pieces, and Valery Beim has an impressive score on the black side.
The most frequently played move after 5...0-0 is 6.Bd3 (theWeiss Variation), with 6...Nc6 the most common response, though 6....Na6, with the idea of ....Nc7, ....Rb8 and ....b5 became popular in the 1980s after 6....Nc6 was found to offer Black few winning chances. 6.e5 is asharptry, with unclear consequences, which was much played in the 1960s, though it has never attained popularity at the highest levels. 6.Be2 is another move which was often seen in the 1950s and early 1960s, although the defeat sustained by Fischer in the game given in the example games spurred White players, including Fischer, to turn to 6.Bd3. In the 1980s, 6.Be2 c5 7.dxc5 Qa5 8.0-0 Qxc5+ 9.Kh1 was revived with more favourable results. 6.Be3 is another possibility, first extensively explored in the 1970s and played byBojan Kurajica,Yuri BalashovandAlexander Beliavsky, which leads to sharp play.
Black's chief alternative to 5...0-0 lies in an immediate strike against the white centre with 5...c5, to which the usual response is either 6.dxc5 or 6.Bb5+. The former allows 6...Qa5. The latter promises a tactical melee, with a common line being 6.Bb5+ Bd7 7.e5 Ng4 8.e6 (8.h3 or 8.Bxd7+ are other possibilities) 8...fxe6, which was thought bad, untilYasser Seirawanplayed the move againstGyula Saxin 1988[9](8...Bxb5 is the alternative, if Black does not want the forced draw in the main line), continuing 9.Ng5 Bxb5!Now if White tries 10.Nxe6, Black has 10...Bxd4!, ignoring the threat to his queen, in view of 11.Nxd8 Bf2+ 12.Kd2 Be3+ with a draw byperpetual check. White can instead try 11.Nxb5, with complicated play.
White can also essay the sharp 6.e5 against 5...c5, after which 6...Nfd7 7.exd6 0-0 is considered to offer good play for Black.
The Classical (Two Knights) System begins 1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Nf3 Bg7 5.Be2 0-0 6.0-0. White contents themselves with the 'classical'pawn centrewith pawns at e4 and d4, forgoing the committal move f2–f4 as Blackcastlesand builds a compact structure.Efim Geller,Anatoly KarpovandEvgeni Vasiukovhave all successfully used this system for White;Zurab Azmaiparashvilihas scored well as Black. This transposes into theSicilian Dragonafter 6...c5 7.Be3 cxd4 8.Nxd4.
The setup f2–f3, Be3 and Qd2 is commonly used against the King's Indian Defence and Dragon Sicilian, and can also be used against the Pirc; indeed, this system is as old as the Pirc itself.
The system 4.f3 was introduced by Argentine players c. 1930 and again in 1950. It was never considered dangerous for Black because of 4.f3 Bg7 5.Be3 c6 6.Qd2 b5. It received a severe blow in about 1985, when Gennady Zaichik showed that Black could castle anyway and play a dangerous gambit with 5...0-0 6.Qd2 e5.
The Argentines feared the sally ...Ng4, though some British players (especiallyMark Hebden,Paul Motwani,Gary Lane, later alsoMichael Adams) came to realise that this was mainly dangerous for Black, therefore playing Be3 and Qd2 in all sorts of move orders, while omitting f2–f3. They called this the150 Attack, because players of this strength (150ECF) can easily play this position and get strong play without anytheory.[10]
The original Argentine idea probably is only viable after 4.Be3 Bg7 5.Qd2 0-0 6.0-0-0 c6 (or Nc6) 7.f3 b5 8.h4. Black usually does not castle, though, and prefers 5...c6 or even 4...c6. The question of whether and when to insert Nf3 remains unclear.
After 1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3, Black has an alternative to 3...g6 (Main line) known as thePribyl SystemorCzech Defence, beginning 3...c6. The lines often transpose to the Pirc if Black later plays ...g6; alternatively, Black can play ...Qa5 and ...e5 to challenge White's centre, or expand on thequeensidewith ...b5.
A common deviation by Black in recent practice is 1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 e5. This has been tried by many GMs over the years, includingZurab AzmaiparashviliandChristian Bauer. White's 4.dxe5 is known to be equal, and play normally continues 4...dxe5 5.Qxd8+ Kxd8 6.Bc4 Be6 7.Bxe6 fxe6. Instead, White normallytransposesto thePhilidor Defencewith 4.Nf3.
An unusual deviation for Black is 1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 e6, which can transpose to theScheveningen Variationof theSicilian Defenceafter 4.Nf3 Be7 5.Bb5+ c6 6.Be2 0-0 7.Be3 c5 8.0-0 cxd4 9.Nxd4.
An unusual but quite reasonable deviation for White is 1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.f3. At the 1989BarcelonaWorld Cup event, formerworld championGarry Kasparovsurprised American grandmasterYasser Seirawanwith this move. After 3...g6 4.c4, an unhappy Seirawan found himself defending theKing's Indian Defencefor the first time in his life,[11]though he managed to draw the game. Black can avoid a King's Indian with 3...e5, which may lead to anOld Indiantype of position after 4.d5, with 3...c5, which may lead to aBenonitype of position after 4.d5 or transpose to Prins Variation of theSicilian Defenceafter 4.Ne2 cxd4 5.Nxd4, or with 3...d5. This can transpose to the Classical Variation of theFrench Defenceafter 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 e6 6.Nf3, to the Tarrasch Variation of the French Defence after 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 e6 6.c3 c5 7.Nd2 Nc6 8.Ndf3, or even to theBlackmar–Diemer Gambitwith an extratempofor White after 4.Nc3 dxe4 5.Bg5 exf3 6.Nxf3.

Some of the systems employed by White against the Pirc Defence include the following:

ThePonziani Openingis achess openingthat begins with the moves:
It is one of the oldest chess openings, having been discussed in literature by 1497. It was advocated byHoward Staunton, generally considered the world's strongest player from 1843 to 1851, in his 1847 bookThe Chess-Player's Handbook. For some decades, it was often called "Staunton's Opening" or the "English Knight's Game" as a result. Today, it is usually known by the name ofDomenico Lorenzo Ponziani, whose main contribution to the opening was his introduction, in 1769, of thecountergambit3...f5!?
The opening is now considered inferior to 3.Bb5, theRuy Lopez, and 3.Bc4, theItalian Game, and is accordingly rarely seen today at any level of play. Magnus Carlsen used it for a victory in 2013.[1]Black's main responses are 3...Nf6, leading toquietplay, and 3...d5, leading tosharpplay. Ponziani's countergambit 3...f5!? was successfully played in thegrandmastergameHikaru Nakamura–Julio Becerra Rivero, US Championship 2007.[2]
The Ponziani is one of the oldest known openings, having been first discussed in chess literature by no later than 1497. It was mentioned in both of the earliest chess treatises: theRepetición de Amores y Arte de Ajedrez con ci Iuegos de PartidobyLucena[3]and theGöttingen manuscript.[4]Today the opening bears the surname ofDomenico Lorenzo Ponziani. Although Ponziani did analyze the opening in 1769, his principal contribution was the introduction of thecountergambit3...f5!?[5]Later the opening was favored byHoward Staunton, who inThe Chess-Player's Handbook(1847) called it "so full of interest and variety, that its omission in many of the leading works on the game is truly unaccountable. ... it deserves, and, if we mistake not, will yet attain a higher place in the category of legitimate openings than has hitherto been assigned to it."[5]
Staunton cumbersomely referred to the opening as "The Queen's Bishop's Pawn Game in the King's Knight's Opening",[5]as didGeorge H. D. GossipinThe Chess Player's Manual(1888, American edition 1902).[6]Napoleon Marache, one of the leading American players, similarly called it the "Queen's Bishop's Pawn Game" in his 1866 manual.[7]In their treatiseChess Openings Ancient and Modern(1889, 1896),E. Freeboroughand theReverend C.E. Rankencalled it "Staunton's Opening".[8][9]In an appendix to later editions of Staunton's work, R.F. Green, editor ofBritish Chess Magazine, also called it "Staunton's Opening", directing those seeking a definition of "Ponziani's Game" to the former name.[10]Green referred to 3...f5 as "Ponziani's Counter Gambit".[11]Chess historianH. J. R. Murrayin his celebrated 1913 workA History of Chesscalled the opening simply the "Staunton",[12]explaining that he was using "the ordinary names of the Openings as used by English players of the present day".[13]James Masonin his treatiseThe Art of Chess(Fourth Edition c. 1910?) referred to the opening as the "Ponziani–Staunton Attack".[14]The famous GermanHandbuch des Schachspiels, which went through eight editions between 1843 and 1916, called it the "Englisches Springerspiel" (English Knight's Game).[15]The Reverend E.E. Cunnington inThe Modern Chess Primer(Thirteenth Edition 1933) referred to it as the "Ponziani Opening (sometimes called Staunton's)".[16]
Wilhelm Steinitz, the firstWorld Champion, in his 1895 treatiseThe Modern Chess Instructor(Part II), called the opening the "Ponziani Opening",[17]as did his successor,Emanuel Lasker, inLasker's Manual of Chess.[18]Similarly,Frank MarshallinChess Openings,[19]the authors ofModern Chess Openings(Second Edition 1913),[20]andSiegbert TarraschinThe Game of Chess(1931, English translation 1938)[21]called it "Ponziani's Opening". William Cook inThe Chess Players' Compendium(Fifth Edition 1910) called it "Ponziani's Game",[22]whileFrancis Joseph Leeand Gossip inThe Complete Chess – Guide(1903) called it "Ponziani's Knight's Game".[23]Contemporary authors likewise call it the "Ponziani Opening",[24][25]"Ponziani's Opening",[26]or simply the "Ponziani".[27]
The Ponziani is rarely played today except as a surprise weapon, because Black has the pleasant choice betweenequalizingeasily and attempting to obtain an advantage with sharper play.[28]White's third move prepares to build a powerfulpawn centerwith 4.d4, a logical objective also seen in the more popularRuy LopezandGiuoco Piano. However, 3.c3 is somewhat premature because the move: 1) takes away the most natural square for White'squeen knight,[29]2) temporarily creates aholeon d3, and 3)developsa pawn rather than a piece, leaving White behind in development[30]and not well placed to meet a counterattack in thecenter. Moreover, unlike in the Giuoco Piano, where White's d4 advance attacks Black'sking bishopon c5, in the Ponziani d4 will not gain atempo. On the positive side, the move 3.c3 creates a second diagonal for the white queen.[30]
As early as 1904, Marshall wrote that, "There is no point in White's third move unless Black plays badly. ... White practically surrenders theprivilege of the first move."[31]More recently,Graham Burgesscalled the Ponziani "a relic from a bygone age, popular neither at top level nor at club level".[32]Bruce Pandolfinihas said,
Curiously, every great teacher of openings who investigated the Ponziani has concluded that it leads to interesting play and deserves to be played more often. Yet it has never captured the fancy of chessplayers in general, and it remains to be seen whether the Ponziani is an opening of the past or of the future.[33]
InChess Master vs. Chess Amateur,Max Euweand Walter Meiden wrote, "What should one do with this opening? It is no opening for beginners, because tactics predominate in the play. There are no simple strategic principles to govern the general lines in this opening."[30]
After 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.c3 the main continuations are:
Here is a quietdrawtypical of the 3...Nf6 line:
While this game was agreed drawn there are good winning chances for White in this type of endgame.[44]
The variation 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.c3 Nge7 has been attributed to Reti due to him having tried it against Tartakower and lost. Recent analysis gives White the edge, i.e. 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.c3 Nge7 4.Bc4 (immediately targeting f7) d5 5.exd5 Nxd5 and now either 6.0-0 or 6.Qb3 lead to a White advantage.[45]Also playable for White is 4.Bb5 whichtransposesto a line of theCozio Defense to the Ruy Lopez.[46]
Here are two games illustrating the wild tactical play that often develops in the 3...d5 4.Qa4 f6 5.Bb5 Ne7 line:

## Queens Gambit
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Queens-Gambit)
The Queen's Gambit is one of the oldest and most reputable 1.d4 openings for White. Unlike 1.e4 openings, the Queen's Gambit usually evolves into a strategic game rather than an all-out tactical battle. Despite being around for centuries, this opening is still one of the cornerstones of every elite players' repertoire. It's also an excellent choice for beginners and intermediate players.
TheQueen's Gambitstarts after the moves1.d4 d5 2.c4. White's second move attacks the d5-pawn, increasing control over the center. If Black decides to take the pawn with 2...dxc4, White will have successfully deflected one of Black's central pawns to the board's wing.
Despite its name, the Queen's Gambit doesn't quite gambit a pawn since Black can't really hang on to the extra pawn safely.
Black can meet the Queen's Gambit by capturing the white c4-pawn (Queen's Gambit Accepted) or trying to hold on to their d5-pawn (Queen's Gambit Declined and Slav Defense). Numerous variations branch out from each of those options.
The Slav Defense is the most popular variation against 2.c4. Black declines the gambit and reinforces the central d4-pawn with 2...c6. Black avoids locking the light-squared bishop inside the pawn chain like in the Queen's Gambit Declined (discussed below). The Slav Defense has a large amount of theory and is considered a different opening on its own.
1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6
Black's second most played option is the Queen's Gambit Declined. Black doesn't take the white pawn on c4 and instead reinforces their center with 2...e6. Another solid option for Black, this choice has the downside of placing a pawn on the light-squared bishop's way.
Black's plan usually involves counterattacking White's d4-pawn with the c7-c5 push. In most cases, one of the players accepts creating structural weaknesses for dynamic compensation, such as taking the initiative or brewing a powerful attack.
1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6
The Queen's Gambit Accepted can be a safe way of playing against 2.c4 if Black knows what to do. After taking the pawn with 2...cxd4, Black should not try to hold on to it but instead focus on developing their pieces while White recaptures the pawn.
Black's light-squared bishop, which is usually a problem in the Queen's Gambit Declined, usually finds a good spot on b7 or g4 in this variation. Black will also try to force White to accept an isolated d-pawn, which could become a target.
1.d4 d5 2.c4 dxc4
The Queen's Gambit is an exceptional opening for White, and the well-prepared player should get more than satisfying results with it. Still, Black can find some counterplay and reach balanced positions in many lines even if White plays with precision. Below are three variations that should help you face the Queen's Gambit.
Even though the Queen's Gambit Accepted has a reputation of sometimes leading to stale positions, this is one of the best-scoring variations for Black. Of the more than 23,000 games in our masters' database, Black wins 25%, draws 38%, and loses 38%.
1.d4 d5 2.c4 dxc4
If you'd rather decline the gambit, the Slav Defense is a good option. Despite its heavy theory, this defense will give you a solid position even if you learn just the basics of it. Black wins 21% of games with the Slav, draws 39%, and loses 40%.
1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6

If you prefer sharper positions, the Albin Countergambit might be a good choice for you. Black responds to White's pawn offer with 2...e5, offering a gambit themselves. This move can lead to wild positions and hidden traps, so White must know how to respond accurately.
You should note that masters don't typically go for this line since it's too risky. With accurate play, White should have no problem building a considerable advantage. Still, the Albin Countergambit is one of the best-scoring lines among non-professional players.
1.d4 d5 2.c4 e5
The Queen's Gambit is one of the oldest openings in chess. Its earliest record comes from the Gottingen manuscript, written circa 1490. Later, masters Alessandro Salvio andGioachino Grecoanalyzed the opening in the first part of the 17th century. However, it wasn't until the 1890s that masters started including 1.d4 in their repertoire.
Positional play became more prominent by the end of the 19th century, bringing more attention to the Queen's Gambit. By the beginning of the 20th century, the opening became very prominent among elite players. In fact, the opening became so popular that chess legendsAlexander AlekhineandJose Raul Capablancaplayed it in 32 out of the 34 games of their 1927 world championship match.
The Queen's Gambit continues to be extremely popular among elite players today. Of the top ten players in the world (as of April 2021), eight of them have the Queen's Gambit as one of their most-played openings as White—GMsMagnus Carlsen,Ding Liren,Levon Aronian,Anish Giri,Alexander Grischuk,Wesley So,Shakhriyar Mamedyarov, andTeimour Radjabov.
Being one of the most popular openings in history, it's not hard to find impressive games in most of the variations of the Queen's Gambit. Below you can see two games in the Queen's Gambit Declined and another one in the Queen's Gambit Accepted.
Alekhine vs Lasker, 1934


Bernstein vs. Capablanca, 1914
Karpov vs. Kasparov, 1984

## Queens Indian Defense
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Queens-Indian-Defense)
The Queen's Indian Defense is a hypermodern opening for Black in response to White's 1.d4. When coupled with the Nimzo-Indian Defense, Black gets a complete defense against White's queen's pawn openings. A solid opening, the Queen's Indian is a reputable option for players who seek a "risk-free" game.
Players of all levels can play the Queen's Indian, although it is advisable to have a basic understanding of positional concepts before venturing into this opening. Players seeking to learn the Queen's Indian from the masters can study the games of none other than former world champion GMAnatoly Karpov.
The Queen's Indian Defense occurs after the moves1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 b6. In hypermodern style, Black refrains from immediately occupying the center with pawns and instead focuses on piece development. After White sidesteps the Nimzo-Indian Defense with 3.Nf3, Black plays 3...b6 to either fianchetto the queen's bishop or develop it to a6.
Black accepts less space for a solid position that still offers active chances. Black will usually try to exchange off one or two minor pieces to attenuate their problems with space. On the other hand, White can get an advantage if they successfully control the e4-square without making significant concessions.
There are many variations of the Queen's Indian Defense. Below you can see the main lines.
The Fianchetto Nimzowitsch Variation is the most played line of the Queen's Indian Defense and starts after1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 b6 4.g3 Ba6. Black immediately puts pressure on the c4-pawn with their bishop. White's best response is to continue with 5.b3 to protect the pawn, and from there, the game can take many directions.
The Fianchetto Traditional Line starts after the moves1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 b6 4.g3 Bb7. This line used to be the most popular way of playing the Queen's Indian and is still a good way to play the opening. Black usually manages to exchange a minor piece to alleviate their lack of space. White often plays de d4-d5 push to blunt Black's strong b7-bishop.
The Petrosian Variation occurs with the moves1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 b6 4.a3. This line is perhaps one of the sharpest ways for White to respond to the Queen's Indian. White invests a tempo with a2-a3 to safely develop their queen's knight to c3 without letting Black pin it with ...Bb4. White usually gets a mobile pawn center that helps in creating dangerous attacks.
The Kasparov Variation starts after the moves1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 b6 4.Nc3. White develops the knight and accepts the possibility of transposing to the Nimzo-Indian Defense. White can also transpose into the Petrosian Variation, a strategy that GM Garry Kasparov himself preferred. If play continues in the Kasparov variation, players usually reach drawish positions with no weaknesses on either side.
The Spassky System starts with the moves1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 b6 4.e3. White prepares to develop their light-squared bishop and castle and usually develops their other bishop to b2. Closed positions are common in this line, with complex middlegames where piece maneuvering is essential for survival.
The Queen's Indian Defense was first deeply analyzed and developed byAron Nimzowitschand other hypermodernists at the beginning of the 21st century. The opening gained traction between the 1920s and 1930s when there was no doubt that the opening was a solid choice that still left room for Black to fight for a win.
The opening's solid reputation led many to believe that there was no way for White to gain a real advantage against it. This belief was likely part of the reason why interest in fighting against the Queen's Indian slowly decreased after the 1940s.
It wasn't until the 1980s that the opening surged in popularity once again. New ideas for White came to light, rekindling interest in the opening.

# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Indian_Defense)
TheQueen's Indian Defense[1](QID) is achess openingdefined by the moves:
The opening is a solid defense to theQueen's Pawn Game.[2]3...b6 increases Black's control over the central light squares e4 and d5 by preparing tofianchettothequeen's bishop, with the opening deriving its name from this maneuver. As in the otherIndian defenses, Black attempts to control thecenterwithpiecesinhypermodernstyle, instead of occupying it withpawnsin classical style.
By playing 3.Nf3, White sidesteps theNimzo-Indian Defensethat arises after 3.Nc3 Bb4. The Queen's Indian is regarded as the sister opening of the Nimzo-Indian, since both openings aim to impede White's efforts to gain full control of the center by playing e2–e4. Together, they are a well-respected response to 1.d4.
4. g3(ECOE15–E19) has long been White's most popular line against the Queen's Indian. It contests thelong diagonalby preparing to fianchetto the light-squared bishop. The standard response for Black through the 1970s was 4...Bb7, but 4...Ba6 has since become the topical line. A rarer third option is 4...Bb4+, which aims to exchange the less useful dark-squared bishop, though this line tends to leave Black with a slightly passive position.
White can defend the pawn at c4 with a piece by playing 5.Nbd2, 5.Qa4, 5.Qc2 or 5.Qb3, but these moves all diminish control of d4, making ...c7–c5 an effective reply for Black; therefore5. b3is White's most common response.[3]However, it weakens the dark squares slightly, which Black can take advantage of by playing5... Bb4+. Now 6.Nbd2?loses material after 6...Bc3 7.Rb1 Bb7 threatening 8...Be4, an opening trap which has ensnared players such asKamran Shirazi.[4]White's best move is therefore6. Bd2. However, after6... Be7 7. Bg2 c6Black is ready to play ...d7–d5, again attacking the c-pawn. If White plays cxd5 then ...cxd5 is considered toequalizefor Black. Thus White usually plays8. Bc3to clear the d2-square, and after8... d5White can play in two ways. After9. Nbd2 Nbd7 10. 0-0 0-0 11. Re1 c5Black has achieved his thematicpawn breakbefore White and the resulting position after12. e4 dxe4 13. Nxe4is equal. Therefore, the main line continues9. Ne5and since Black does not want White to maintain this knight on a strong central outpost, play continues9... Nfd7 10. Nxd7 Nxd7 11. Nd2 0-0 12. 0-0 Rc8 13. e4. By diverting the black knight on move 9 it is now White who has achieved his central pawn break first. The effect of Black's check 5...Bb4+ has been to lure White's bishop to c3 where it blocks the c-file. This, the current main line of the Queen's Indian, is considered equal bytheoryand became a frequent guest in grandmaster praxis in the 1980s.
After5. b3, Black also has several playable alternatives to 5...Bb4+, the most common of which is5... Bb7 6. Bg2 Bb4+ 7. Bd2 a5. When White plays Nc3, Black will exchange bishop for knight in order to enhance his control over the central light squares, and play on thequeensidewith moves such as ...a5–a4 and ...b5. Other possibilities for Black include 5...d5 and 5...b5.
More recently, several grandmasters, includingAlexander Beliavsky,Ni Hua,Veselin Topalov, andMagnus Carlsen, have played5. Qc2. The idea is to allow Black's counterthrust ...c5, the main line running5... Bb7 6. Bg2 c5. The fashion is for White to sacrifice a pawn with7. d5, gaining active play. This idea has scored well for White,[5]and new ideas have been cropping up since 2008.[6]The 5.Qc2 lines had previously scored poorly for White according to Emms.[3]
The classical main line of the Queen's Indian, the most frequently played line from the 1950s until 4...Ba6 became popular in the 1980s, usually continues:5. Bg2 Be7 6. 0-0 0-0 7. Nc3 Ne4 8. Qc2 Nxc3 9. Qxc3. White has aspatial advantage, but Black has no weaknesses and can choose from a variety of ways to create counterplay, such as9... c5,9... f5or9... Be4. These lines are well known for theirdrawishtendencies and4... Bb7is nowadays often employed by Black as a drawing weapon. White has tried various deviations from the main line in an attempt to unbalance the play. These include:
The Petrosian Variation, prepares 5.Nc3 by stopping ...Bb4pinningtheknight. White intends to follow up with Nc3 and e4, building a large pawn center. Black usually responds by contesting the e4-square with ...Bb7 and ...d5. (See Gurevich, 1992, for an extensive analysis.) This variation was often used byGarry Kasparovearly in his career.
Black can choose between 4...Bb7 and 4...Bb4.
Preparing to develop theking's bishopand castlekingside, was also a favorite ofTigran Petrosian. This apparently quiet development may lead to complex middlegame play. Black usually replies 4...Bb7, then play may continue 5.Bd3 d5 6.0-0 or 5.Nc3 Bb4, transposing into the Nimzo-Indian Defence.
TheMilesVariation, which simply develops the bishop to a good square. Despite some success by its originator, this idea has never been popular.
TheEncyclopaedia of Chess Openingsclassifies the Queen's Indian under codes E12 to E19 according to the following scheme:

One of my favorite openings for white. Please tell what you think of it please.
Also any faults in the opening?
The more critical line would probably be the continuation 5.dxc3 by black, after which I believe the most logical continuation for white is either 6.Nxc3 or 6.O-O cxb2 7.Bxb2, gambiting another pawn similar to the Danish.  In the line you posted, black simply allows white to regain the pawn with a gain of time, which is obviously good for white.  Techinically, it's not even a gambit at that point.

## Reti Gambit

In the Reti - named for Richard Reti, one of the founders of Hypermodernism - White combines the move Nf3 and the fianchetto of the king's-bishop with the flank blow c2-c4. Thus he is trying to attack the black center from the side.

## Reti Opening
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Reti-Opening)
1.Nf3 develops a piece instead of moving a pawn to begin the game. The knight develops to a good square that controls the center while keeping flexible options with the central pawns. A later d2-d4 move may transpose to a 1.d4 opening (while avoiding certain lines), while a later c2-c4 move might transpose to theEnglish Opening.
The Reti Opening can be used to refer to two different starting positions:
On Chess.com, 1.Nf3 is considered the Reti and 1.Nf3 d5 2.c4 is considered the Reti Gambit.
Because of its flexibility, the Reti Opening often transposes into something else, but there are some independent lines.
The Reti Gambit begins1.Nf3 d5 2.c4. Taking with2...dxc4is generally not recommended for Black, as it weakens Black's central control and (despite the variation's name as a "gambit") White can easily regain the pawn anyway, for example with3.Na3and4.Nxc4. Instead, Black usually reinforces the central pawn with either2...c6or2...e6, both of which are sometimes considered transpositions into the English Opening.
2...d4is also popular, gaining space but opening up the h1-a8 diagonal for White's kingside fianchetto; overall it is Black's most successful reply. After3.g3, Black can either reinforce the pawn with3...c5or play3...Nc6with the idea of4.Bg2 e5.
The other independently important variation after 1.Nf3 is theKing's Indian Attack(KIA). White quickly develops the kingside with g3, Bg2, and castles. Meanwhile Black's most common approach is to try to blunt the fianchettoed bishop's diagonal with ...d5 and ...c6.

1.Nf3 is often simply used, however, as a flexible first move that can turn into any number of other openings. Examples of how easily the Reti can transpose include:
The Reti Opening, named forRichard Reti, is a product of thehypermodern schoolthat became popular in the 20th century. That is suggested in its name, as Reti was one of the leading proponents of hypermodernism.
For most of chess history,1.e4was by far the most popular opening move. Late in the 19th century,1.d4became very popular as well.
The hypermodernists, however, preferred to control the center indirectly instead of occupying it with a pawn on move one. By starting the game with 1.Nf3, White develops a piece but remains flexible in how to approach the game overall.
In 1924, Reti used 1.Nf3 to win a game againstJose Raul Capablanca, ending the classical-style superstar's eight-year, 63-game winning streak. That game, more than any other, helped the hypermodern school and the move 1.Nf3 to become widely accepted.
In the same tournament Reti also won a famous brilliancy against Efim Bogoljubov with 1.Nf3 d5 2.c4.

# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9ti_Opening)
TheRéti Openingis a hypermodernchess openingwhose "traditional" or "classic method" begins with the moves:[1]
White attacks Black's pawn from theflank, which may occasion 2...dxc4. White may couple this plan with akingsidefianchetto(g3 and Bg2) to create pressure on the light squares in thecenter.
The opening is named afterCzechoslovakianchess playerRichard Réti(1889–1929). The opening is in the spirit of the hypermodernism movement that Réti championed, with the center being dominated from the wings rather than by direct occupation. If White fianchettoes both bishops, castles kingside, and refrains from occupying the center with pawns, the result may be described as theRéti System.[1]
In theEncyclopaedia of Chess Openings, Réti Opening is classified as codes A04–A09, where it is closely associated with theKing's Indian Attack.[2]
According to Réti, the opening was introduced into master play in the early part of 1923.[3]Réti used the opening most famously to defeatJosé Raúl Capablanca, the reigningWorld Chess Champion, in a game at the1924 New York tournament.[4]Alexander Alekhineplayed the Réti in the 1920s, but at that time almost any game that began with Nf3 and c4 by White was considered to be the Réti. Réti popularized these moves against all defenses in the spirit ofhypermodernism, and as the opening developed it gained structure and a clearer distinction between it and other openings.
Hans Kmochcalled the system of attack employed by Réti in the game Réti–Rubinstein, Carlsbad 1923,[5]"the Réti Opening" or "the Réti System".Savielly Tartakowercalled the opening the "Réti–Zukertort Opening", and said of 1.Nf3: "An opening of the past, which became, towards 1923, the opening of the future."[6]
In modern times the Réti refers only to the configuration Nf3 and c4 by White with ...d5 by Black, where Whitefianchettosat least one bishop and does not play an early d4.[7]
After 2.c4 (ECOcode A09), Black's choices are:
If Black takes the pawn, then in the same manner as theQGA, 3.e3 or 3.e4 regains the pawn with a slight advantage to White, as Black is left somewhat undeveloped. 3.Na3 and 3.Qa4+ are also good, and commonly played. This variety of White options limits the popularity of 2...dxc4. Trying to protect the pawn with 3...b5?!allows 4.a4!leaving White with a superior position. The alternatives 2...d4, 2...c6, and 2...e6 are more common, with the latter two generally leading to aQueen's Gambittype of position, and 2...d4 typically being answered with 3.e3 or the interesting 3.b4!?

TheRousseau Gambit(orPonziani CountergambitafterDomenico Lorenzo Ponziani) is achess openingthat begins with the moves:
The gambit is named after French chess masterEugène Rousseau. White can decline the gambit by supporting the e-pawn with 4.d3. The resulting position is similar to aKing's Gambit Declinedwith colours reversed, and White'sking bishopaiming at Black's weakenedkingside. Black will have troublecastlingkingside, and Ng5 is a likely threat. White's position is better, but still requires careful play.
Key themes for White are to attack Black's kingside and to avoid attempts by Black tosimplifythe position. Exchanges involving White'slight-square bishopare particularly suspect.
White can decline the gambit and wait to capture the f-pawn. 4...Bc5transposesto theLucchini Gambit.
White still has a good game after the inferior 4.exf5, but the position is less clear. Black usually plays 4...e4, which White may meet by 5.Nd4!Nf6 (5...Nxd4?leads to trouble after 6.Qh5+) 6.Nxc6.

## Ruy Lopez
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Ruy-Lopez-Opening)
The Ruy Lopez (also known as the Spanish Opening or Spanish Game) is one of the oldest and most analyzed openings in chess history. Most of the world's top players have adopted this rich opening as part of their repertoire, and many of them play it with both colors. Despite having a large amount of theory, it is an opening that players of all levels can enjoy.
TheRuy Lopez startsafter the moves1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5. White finishes the development of their kingside pieces and gets ready to castle short. The critical idea behind3.Bb5, however, is to attack Black's c6-knight. White fights for the control of the central d4 and e5-squares and indirectly threatens the black e5-pawn by attacking its only defender.
Although the Ruy Lopez is a flexible opening that can lead to tactical skirmishes, games usually develop into a long struggle for the center that spreads to an attack on the flanks. Since Black has a hard time getting an advantage in this opening, some people refer to it as the "Spanish Torture."
The Ruy Lopez is one of the most studied openings in chess. With all its most popular moves deeply analyzed by generations of elite players, the theory behind the Spanish Game grew to enormous proportions. Below you can find a list of some of the prevalent lines of the opening:
The Main Line of the Ruy Lopez sees White positioning their pieces to prepare for a long struggle for central control. Black starts to fend off the white light-squared bishop with 3...a6. After White castles, the game can still take many different directions.
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.O-O
In the Closed Variation, Black puts their dark-squared bishop on e7, usually inside the pawn chain. After Black's fifth move, play can continue in many different ways.
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7
The Berlin Defense is one of Black's most solid responses to the Ruy Lopez. Players usually go for an early queen exchange. Black accepts doubled pawns on the c-file and forfeits castling rights for the bishop pair and a solid position.
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6
In the Exchange Variation, White captures the black knight on c6 to double Black's pawns. If White plays d2-d4, a favorable endgame with a pawn majority on the kingside can occur. Black gets the bishop pair as compensation and can equalize with accurate play, whether White goes for d2-d4 or a quieter system with d2-d3. This line avoids the need to memorize a lot of theory.
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Bxc6
With the Open Variation, Black takes the white e4-pawn to compensate for their space disadvantage with active piece play. White usually responds by playing 6.d4 to open up the center and try to punish Black's lack of development.
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.O-O Nxe4
The Schliemann-Jaenisch Gambit is one of Black's aggressive ways of meeting the Ruy Lopez. Black immediately strikes back in the center, instead of building a solid position and playing for equality. The imbalanced positions that arise from this variation are difficult to navigate for both sides.
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5
The Marshall Attack was developed by the brilliant attacking playerFrank Marshalland used for the first time againstJose Raul Capablancain 1918. Black gambits a pawn to build a quick attack against the white king.
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.O-O Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 O-O 8.c3 d5

It's a good idea to study some of the theory behind the Ruy Lopez if you want to play against it. Below you can see two ways of meeting this opening—a solid option and an aggressive option:
The Berlin Defense is probably one of the most solid ways of playing against the Ruy Lopez. This line's popularity skyrocketed after GMVladimir Kramnikused it to dethrone GMGarry Kasparovin their world championship match in 2000. White wins 33% of the games, draws 44%, and Black wins 22%.
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6
The Arkhangelsk Variation is a good way for tactical players to face the Ruy Lopez. This line usually leads to open games, where Black can try to use their bishop pair to create counterplay. In this line, White wins 39% of games, draws 30%, and Black wins 30%.
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.O-O b5 6.Bb3 Bb7

The Ruy Lopez is one of the oldest openings in chess. It was first analyzed by the priestRuy Lopez de Segurain his bookLibro de la Invencion Liberal y Arte del Juego del Ajedrez(Book of the Liberal Invention and Art of the Game of Chess) in 1561. However, it wasn't until the mid to late 1800s that top players started using the opening consistently.
From that moment on, the Ruy Lopez never fell out of fashion. The Spanish Opening became hugely popular and continues to be a part of every elite players' repertoire.
With many players choosing the Ruy Lopez as part of their repertoire for both colors, it's easy to find masters to study. Below you can see three of the many classical games in this opening.
Lasker vs. Capablanca, 1914
Karpov vs. Unzicker, 1974
Kasparov vs. Karpov, 1990

TheRuy Lopez(/rɔɪ,ˈruːi/;Spanish:[ˈrujˈlopeθ]),[1]also called theSpanish OpeningorSpanish Game, is achess openingcharacterised by the moves:
The Ruy Lopez is named after 16th-century Spanish priestRuy López de Segura. It is one of the most popular openings, with many variations. In theEncyclopaedia of Chess Openings(ECO), all codes from C60 to C99 are assigned to the Ruy Lopez.
The opening is named after the 16th-centurySpanishpriestRuy López de Segura, who made a systematic study of this and other openings in the 150-page book on chessLibro del Ajedrez, written in 1561.[2]Although it bears his name, this particular opening was included in theGöttingen manuscript, which dates from c.1490.[3]A popular use of the Ruy Lopez opening did not develop, however, until the mid-19th century, when the Finnish andRussian[4]theoreticianCarl Jaenisch"rediscovered" its potential. The opening remains the most commonly used amongst theopen gamesin master play; it has been adopted by almost all players during their careers, many of whom have played it with both colours.[5]Due to the difficulty for Black in achieving equality, a common nickname for the opening is "The Spanish Torture".[6]
At the most basic level, White's third move attacks the knight that defends the e5-pawn from the attack by the f3-knight. White's apparent threat to win Black's e-pawn with  4.Bxc6 dxc6 5.Nxe5 is illusory—Black can respond 5...Qd4,forkingthe knight and e4-pawn, winning back thematerialwith a good position.[7]White's 3.Bb5 is still a good move, however; itdevelopsa piece, preparescastling, and sets up a potentialpinagainst Black's king. Since White's third move carries no immediate threat, Black can respond in a wide variety of ways.
Traditionally, White's objective in playing the Ruy Lopez is to spoil Black'spawn structure; either way Black recaptures following theexchangeon c6 will have negative features, although recapturing gains thebishop pair.[8]In modern practice, however, White does not always exchange bishop for knight on c6, preferring the retreat 4.Ba4 if chased by 3...a6.
The theory of the Ruy Lopez is the most extensively developed of allOpen Games, with some lines having been analysed well beyond move thirty. At nearly every move there are many reasonable alternatives, and most have been deeply explored.[9]It is convenient to divide the possibilities into two groups based on whether or not Black responds with 3...a6, the Morphy Defence, named afterPaul Morphy, although he was not the originator of the line.[10]The variations with Black moves other than 3...a6 are older and generally simpler, but the Morphy Defence lines are more commonly played.
The most commonly played third move for Black is the Morphy Defence, 3...a6, a move which forces White to decide whether to retreat or to exchange for Black's knight.  The Morphy Defence thus "puts the question"[11]to the white bishop, a traditional usage whichLarry Evansattributed toAron Nimzowitsch.[12]The main point of 3...a6 is that after the common retreat 4.Ba4, Black will have the possibility of breaking a future pin on thequeen knightby playing ...b5. White must take some care not to fall into theNoah's Ark Trap, in which Black traps White'sking bishopon the b3-square with a ...a6, ...b5, and ...c4 pawn advance on thequeenside.Ercole del Rio, in his 1750treatiseSopra il giuoco degli Scacchi, Osservazioni pratiche dell'anonimo Modenese(On the game of Chess, practical Observations by an anonymous Modenese), was the first author to mention 3...a6.[13]The move became popular after it was played byPaul Morphyand it is named for him. An influential chess player at that time,Wilhelm Steinitz, did not approve of the move, however; in 1889, he wrote, "on principle this ought to be disadvantageous as it drives the bishop where it wants to go". Steinitz's opinion did not prevail, however; today, 3...a6 is played in over 65 percent of all games beginning with the Ruy Lopez.[14]
After 3...a6, the most commonly played line is the Closed Defence, which goes 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7, discussed in the two following sections. Alternatives to the Closed Defence described in this section are:
In the Exchange Variation, 4.Bxc6, (ECOC68–C69) White damages Black's pawn structure, gaining a ready-made long-term plan of playing d4 ...exd4 Qxd4, followed by exchanging all the pieces and winning the pure pawn ending.Max Euwegives the pure pawn ending in this position (with all pieces except kings removed) as a win for White.[15]Black gains good compensation in the form of the bishop pair, however, and the variation is not considered White's most ambitious, though former world championsEmanuel LaskerandBobby Fischeremployed it with success.
After 4.Bxc6, Black almost always responds 4...dxc6. The similar move 4...bxc6 is rarely played due to the reply 5.d4 exd4 6.Qxd4 which gives Whitecontrol of the centre. After 4...dxc6, the obvious 5.Nxe5?is weak, since 5...Qd4!6.Nf3 Qxe4+ 7.Qe2 Qxe2+ 8.Kxe2 leaves White with nocompensationfor Black's bishop pair.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries,Emanuel Laskerhad great success with 5.d4 exd4 6.Qxd4 Qxd4 7.Nxd4, most notably his famous win againstJosé Raúl Capablancain theSt. Petersburg 1914 chess tournament.[16]
Since then, better defences for Black have been developed, and this line is considered to slightly favour Black. Jon Jacobs wrote in the July 2005Chess Life(p. 21): "A database search (limited to games longer than 20 moves, both players FIDE 2300+) reveals the position after 7.Nxd4 was reached 20 times from 1985–2002. White's results were abysmal: +0−7=13."
After 5.Nc3, Black usually plays 5...f6 to defend the e-pawn. A notable game isAdhiban–Nakamurafrom the2013 FIDE World Cup.[17]
The flexible 5.0-0 is sometimes called the Barendregt Variation, but it was Fischer who developed it into a serious weapon in the 1960s. Unlike 5.d4, it forces Black to defend the e-pawn, usually with 5...f6, 5...Bg4, 5...Qd6 (the sharpest line, preparing queensidecastling), 5...Qf6, 5...Qe7, or 5...Bd6. Some other moves that have been played are 5...Ne7, 5...Be7, and 5...Be6. The idea behind these three moves is that if White plays 6.Nxe5, Black plays 6...Qd4, forking the knight and the e4-pawn. The move ...Qd4, regaining the pawn at e4, is usually impossible in these variations once White has castled, due to the open e-file.
Notable games areFischer–Portisch,[18]andFischer–Gligorić,[19]both played at the17th Chess OlympiadinHavana 1966.
White may also delay the exchange for a move or two: 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.Bxc6 or 5.0-0 Be7 6.Bxc6 (the Delayed Exchange Deferred), for example; at first glance this seems a waste of time, but Black having played ...Nf6 rules out defending the pawn with ...f6, and the bishop already being on e7 means that ...Bd6 would be a loss oftempo.
The Norwegian Variation (also called the Taimanov or Wing Variation) (ECOC70), 3...a6 4.Ba4 b5 5.Bb3 Na5 aims to eliminate the white bishop but is generally considered too time-consuming for Black. The usual continuation is 6.0-0 d6 7.d4 Nxb3, but the speculative sacrifice 6.Bxf7+?!Kxf7 7.Nxe5+, which drives the black king out, has been played. With accurate play, however, Black can avoid any disadvantage while holding onto the extra piece.
In the 1950s,Mark Taimanovplayed it with some success, though it remained a sideline, as it has to this day. This defence has been known since the 1880s and was reintroduced in 1901 byCarl Schlechter. The Norwegian connection was first introduced by Svein Johannessen who played the line from 1957 and later strengthened whenSimen Agdesteinand some other Norwegian players adopted the variation. In 1995Jonathan Tisdallpublished the article "Ruy Lopez. The Norwegian Variation" in New in ChessYearbook37.
The Graz Defence, Classical Defence Deferred, and Møller Defence combine 3...a6 with the active move ...Bc5.
For a century it was believed that it was safer for Black to place the bishop on e7, but it is much more active on c5.
White can gain time by playing c3 and d4 as the black bishop will have to move, but this does not always seem to be as important as was once thought.[20]
The Møller Defence, 3...a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Bc5 was already an old line in 1903 whenJørgen Møller(1873–1944) analysed it inTidskrift för Schack.Alexander Alekhineplayed this for Black in the early portion of his career; despite his advocacy, it never achieved great popularity, and even he eventually came to consider it dubious.
The Graz Defence, 3...a6 4.Ba4 b5 5.Bb3 Bc5, was analysed by Alois Fink (b. 1910) inÖsterreichische Schachzeitungin 1956 and inWiener Schach Nachrichtenin 1979, although it did not become popular until the 1990s.
In the Modern Steinitz Defence (also called Neo-Steinitz Defence) (ECOC71–C76), Black interpolates 3...a6 4.Ba4 before playing 4...d6, which was frequently played byAlexander Alekhine,José Raúl Capablanca, andPaul Keres. The possibility of breaking the pin with a timely ...b5 gives Black more latitude than in the Old Steinitz Defence; in particular, in the Old Steinitz, White can practically force Black to give up the stronghold at e5, but in the Modern Steinitz, Black is able to maintain control of thecentre. Most plausible White moves are playable here, including 5.c3, 5.c4, 5.Bxc6, 5.d4, and 5.0-0. The sharp Siesta Variation arises after 5.c3 f5,[21]while a manoeuvring game results from the calmer 5.c3 Bd7 6.d4. The game is also sharp after 5.Bxc6+ bxc6 6.d4 (ECOC73) or 5.0-0 Bg4 6.h3 h5  (ECOC72). The older lines starting with 5.c4 and 5.d4 are not regarded as testing for Black, though the latter offers a tricky gambit. There are sixECOclassifications for the Modern Steinitz. White's responses 5.d4, 5.Nc3, and 5.c4 are included in C71, while 5.0-0 is C72.  The delayed exchange 5.Bxc6+ bxc6 6.d4 is C73. C74–C76 all begin with 5.c3. C74 covers 5...Nf6, but primarily focuses on 5...f5 6.exf5 Bxf5 with 7.d4 or 7.0-0. C75's main continuation is 5...Bd7 6.d4 Nge7, the Rubinstein Variation. C76 is characterised by the Blackkingsidefianchetto5...Bd7 6.d4 g6.
The Schliemann Defence Deferred, 3...a6 4.Ba4 f5, is rarely seen, with practically its only top-level appearance being in the 1974 Candidates Final, whenViktor Korchnoiadopted it versusAnatoly Karpov.[22]It is considered inferior to the regular Schliemann, since White can answer effectively with 5.d4! exd4 6.e5.
5.Qe2 (ECOC77), first played in the 1840s, normally continues 5...b5 6.Bb3 Be7 7.c3 followed by 8.d4. Robert Wormald (1834–1876) wrote openings manuals and completedStaunton's last book, analyzing the line inChess World, 1867. The line is also known asPaulsen–AlapinAttack, andSchlecterVariation.[23]
The variation 5.d4 (ECOC77), named afterGeorge Henry Mackenziewho employed it on a regular basis, is an old line which, according to modern theory, does not promise White any advantage, though is adopted as an alternative to the main variation 5.0-0. The main line continues with 5...exd4 (5...Nxe4 6.0-0 transposes to theOpen Defence) 6.0-0 (6.e5 Ne4 is harmless) Be7 (6...Nxe4 transposes to the Riga Variation of the Open Defence) which leads to theCentre Attack(ECOC84) of the Closed Defence.
The Steinitz Defence Deferred (ECOC79) also called Russian Defence. With the move order 3...a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 d6, Black waits until White castles before playing ...d6. This can enable Black to avoid some lines in the Steinitz Defence Deferred in which White castles queenside, although the position of the knight on f6 also precludes Black from supporting the centre with ...f7–f6. These nuances seem to have little importance today, as neither the Steinitz Defence Deferred nor the Russian Defence have been popular for many years.
Mikhail Chigorinplayed the Russian Defence in the 1890s, and later it was adopted byAkiba Rubinsteinand Alekhine. The last significant use of the Russian Defence was in the 1950s, when it was played by some Russian masters. Today, however, it has purely practical value, as White has found numerous ways to an opening advantage by quickly opening lines in the center, where Black's developmental lag seems to be a significant factor.
The Arkhangelsk Defence (or Archangel Defence) (ECOC78) was popularized by Soviet players from the city ofArkhangelsksuch as GMVladimir Malaniuk. The variation begins 3...a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 b5 6.Bb3 Bb7. This line often leads to sharp positions in which Black wagers that the fianchettoed bishop's influence on the centre and kingside will offset Black's delay in castling. White has several options, including attempting to build an ideal pawn centre with c3 and d4, defending the e-pawn with Re1 or simply developing. The Arkhangelsk Defence is tactically justified by Black's ability to meet 7.Ng5 with 7...d5 8.exd5 Nd4! (not 8...Nxd5, when White gets the advantage with 9.Qh5 g6 10.Qf3).
The Modern Arkhangelsk Defence (or Modern Archangel Defence) (ECOC78), sometimes called the Neo-Arkhangelsk or Neo-Archangel, is a refinement of the regular Arkhangelsk Defence by incorporating ideas similar to the Møller Defence. Black normally does not fianchetto the queen's bishop, which would transpose to regular Arkhangelsk setups, but plays ...Bg4 to increase the pressure against White's pawn centre. White's main continuation is 7.a4 after which Black responds with the typical move 7...Rb8 reaching the starting point of this highly complex variation. Another line is the more traditional 7.c3 d6 8.d4 and after 8...Bb6 Black's position is fine. 8...exd4 occurred inLöwenthal–Morphy, London 1859,[24]which seems to be the first time this variation was ever played.Fabiano Caruanais one of the most notable players of this variation, employing it in theCandidates Tournament 2020.[25][26]
In the Open Defence, 3...a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Nxe4, Black tries to make use of the time White will take to regain the pawn to gain a foothold in the centre, with play usually continuing 6.d4 b5 7.Bb3 d5 8.dxe5 Be6 (but not 7...exd4? 8.Re1 d5 9.Nc3!,Bobby Fischer–Petar Trifunović,Bled1961[27]).
Here 8.Nxe5, once adopted by Fischer, is much less often seen, and Black should equalise after the accurate 8...Nxe5 9.dxe5 c6, which avoids prematurely committing the light-squared bishop and solidly defends d5, often a problem in the Open.
The Riga Variation, 6...exd4, is considered inferior; the main line runs 7.Re1 d5 8.Nxd4 Bd6! 9.Nxc6 Bxh2+! 10.Kh1! (10.Kxh2 Qh4+ 11.Kg1 Qxf2+ draws by perpetual check.) Qh4 11.Rxe4+! dxe4 12.Qd8+! Qxd8 13.Nxd8+ Kxd8 14.Kxh2 Be6 (14...f5??15.Bg5#) and now theendgameis considered to favour White after 15.Be3 or Nd2 (but not 15.Nc3 c5!, playing to trap the bishop). A famous example of this line is the gameJosé Raúl Capablanca–Edward Lasker, New York 1915.[28]White is objectively better here, but Black keeps some good practical chances owing to the sharp positions that occur.
White has a variety of options at move nine, including 9.c3, 9.Be3, 9.Qe2, and 9.Nbd2.
The classical line starts with 9.c3 when Black may choose 9...Be7 (the main line) or the aggressive 9...Bc5.
After 9.c3 Bc5 10.Nbd2 0-0 11.Bc2, Black must meet the attack on e4, with the following possibilities from which to choose: 11...f5, 11...Bf5, both of which aim to maintain the strongpoint on e4, or the forcing line 11...Nxf2, introduced by the English amateur Vernon Dilworth.
Today, 9.Be3 Be7 10.c3 is often used to transpose into the main line, 9.c3, while obviating the option of the Dilworth.
An old continuation is 11...f5, when after 12.Nb3 Bb6 13.Nfd4 Nxd4 14.Nxd4 Bxd4 White can gain some advantage withBogoljubov's15.Qxd4. Instead, the very sharp La Grande Variante continues 15.cxd4 f4 16.f3 Ng3 17.hxg3 fxg3 18.Qd3 Bf5 19.Qxf5 Rxf5 20.Bxf5 Qh4 21.Bh3 Qxd4+ 22.Kh1 Qxe5, with unclear consequences. Perhaps the most famous game in this variation isSmyslov–Reshevsky, 1945 USSR–USA Radio Match.[29]An analysis of the line had just been published in a Russian chess magazine, and Smyslov was able to follow it to quickly obtain a winning position. Reshevsky had not seen the analysis and he struggled in vain to solve the position over the board with hischess clockrunning. The Dilworth Variation (or Attack), 11...Nxf2 12.Rxf2 f6 13.exf6 Bxf2+ 14.Kxf2 Qxf6 has scored well for Black, with many traps for the ill-prepared White player. The main line leads to unbalanced endgames which are difficult to play for both sides, though with a strong drawing tendency.Artur Yusupovis one of the fewgrandmasterswho has adopted the Dilworth repeatedly.[30][31][32]
In the Howell Attack (ECOC81), 9.Qe2, White aims for play against d5 after Rd1. The game usually continues 9...Be7 10.Rd1 followed by 10...Nc5 or 10...0-0.Paul Keresplayed this line againstMax EuweandSamuel Reshevskyat theWorld Chess Championship tournament 1948.[33][34]This has been played at the top by World No.2Fabiano Caruanaamong others, and he recommends this in his video series for Chessbase.
Karpov'smove, 9.Nbd2, limits Black's options. In the 1978 Karpov–KorchnoiWorld Chess Championshipmatch, following 9.Nbd2 Nc5 10.c3 d4 (10...Be7 is an old move that remains popular) Karpov introduced the surprising 11.Ng5!?, a move suggested by his trainer,Igor Zaitsev.[35]If Black takes the knight with 11...Qxg5 White regains the material with 12.Qf3. This variation played a decisive role in a later World Championship match,Kasparov–Anand1995, when Anand was unable to successfully defend as Black.[36]
In the main line, White normally retreats the bishop with 4.Ba4, when the usual continuation is 4...Nf6 5.0-0 Be7.
Black now threatens to win a pawn with 6...b5 followed by 7...Nxe4, so White must respond.
Usually White defends the e-pawn with 6.Re1 which, in turn, threatens Black with the loss of a pawn after 7.Bxc6 and 8.Nxe5.
Although it is possible to defend the pawn with 6...d6, Black most commonly averts this threat by driving away the white bishop with 6...b5 7.Bb3.
After 4...Nf6 5.0-0 Be7, the most frequently seen continuation is 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 0-0, discussed in the next section.
Examined in this section are the alternatives to the main line:
The Delayed Exchange Variation Deferred (or Exchange Variation Doubly Deferred) (ECOC85), 6.Bxc6, loses a tempo compared to the Exchange Variation, though in compensation, the black knight on f6 and bishop on e7 are awkwardly placed. The knight on f6 prevents Black from supporting the e-pawn with ...f7–f6, and the bishop is somewhat passively posted on e7.
The Centre Attack (or Centre Variation) (ECOC84), 6.d4, leads to sharp play. After 6...exd4 (6...Nxe4 and 6...b5 are viable alternatives) 7.Re1 b5 (7...0-0 8.e5 Ne8 is a playable alternative) White can play either 8.Bb3 or the sharp 8.e5. In case of the immediate 7.e5 Black takes advantage of the absence of the white rook from e1 and plays 7...Ne4 with the idea of 8...Nc5.
The Morphy Attack (ECOC84) named after Paul Morphy who introduced the idea ina 1859 blindfolded simul, is aggressive and may lead to a very small edge for White, but less than in 6.Re1 and 6.d3. Similar to those two moves, White's defence of his e-pawn compels Black to drive away White's bishop with 6...b5 (6...d6 is also possible, but less popular). After 7.Bb3, Black can play 7...0-0 or 7...d6. Note that Marshall attack-style ideas of 7...0-0 and playing ...d5 next, sacrificing a pawn, make little sense when White's knight on c3 both controls d5 and means White has a more developed queenside, one of the upsides of the Marshall usually being White's underdeveloped queenside. The main line of 7...d6, 8.Nd5 Na5 9.Nxe7 Qxe7 10.d3 0-0, with Black eventually relinquishing White of his bishop pair with ...Nxb3, shows a common attacking idea in the Morphy Attack; Nd5. In the main line, 8...Nxd5? is wrong because 9.Bxd5! leaves White with a strong bishop on the outpost square d5, exerting a troublesome pin on the undefended c6-knight. After 7...0-0, 8.d3 transposes to one of the main lines of 6.d3, with 6... b5 7.Bb3 0-0 8.Nc3.Paul KeresandBoris Spasskyhave both played the line a few times throughout their careers (both playing it against one another once), andSiegbert Tarraschplayed it three times in his 1911 match against Schlechter (scoring 1 win, 1 draw, 1 loss in that order), but it remains the least popular option for White on move 6.
In the Worrall Attack (ECOC86), White replaces 6.Re1 with 6.Qe2. The idea is that the queen will support the e-pawn, leaving the rook free to move to d1 to support the advance of the d-pawn, although there is not always time for this. Play normally continues 6...b5 7.Bb3 followed by 7...0-0 8.c3 and 8...d5 or 8...d6.
Paul Keresplayed the line several times. More recently,Sergei Tiviakovhas played it, as hasNigel Short, who essayed it twice in his 1992 match againstAnatoly Karpovand won both games.[37][38]
By playing 6.d3, often called the Martinez Variation,[39]White steers clear of the Marshall Attack and any of the anti-Marshall lines. White threatens 7.Bxc6 winning the e5-pawn leaving Black a choice of either 6...d6 or 6...b5. After 6...d6 the e5-pawn is firmly defended and Black threatens to trade off White's Ruy Lopez bishop with 7...b5 and 8...Na5. White normally continues with 7.c3, and after 8...0-0 White can choose between 9.Nbd2 or 9 Re1. Black can also play 6...b5, and after 7.Bb3 d6 (7...0-0 is a viable alternative) White has to deal with the threat of 8...Na5 by playing 8.a3 (8.c3 or 8.a4 are perfectly playable as well), and after 8...0-0 (the immediate 8...Na5 is also feasible) 9.Nc3 we have reached a moderntabiyaof the Ruy Lopez. This position was first reached in a high-level encounter betweenViswanathan AnandandMichael Adams,Grenke Chess Classic2013.[40]6.d3 has gained wide popularity among the top players and has almost supplanted the Ruy Lopez main line with 6.Re1.
This variation can transpose into 6.Re1 lines but with a potentially advantageous move order. For example, in the 8.a4 anti-Marshall variation which can ensue after 6.Re1, one of the mainlines is 8...Bb7 9.d3, which can also be reached by way of 6.d3 b5 7.Bb3 0-0 8.a4 Bb7 9.Re1. A perhaps more challenging response to the anti-Marshall is 8...b4, after which White may wish to ambitiously play 9.a5 (preventing ...Na5) d6 10.d3 Be6!, where White cannot avoid the trade of bishops (the main moves being either 11.Bxe6 or 11.Nbd2 Bxb3). If Black elects not to exchange, however, we may see 11.Nbd2 Rb8 12.Nc4 where White may retain some pull in the position. On the other hand, to be considered is 6.d3 b5 7.Bb3 0-0 8.a4 b4 9.a5 d6 10.Nbd2 Be6 11.Nc4!, where White has avoided the exchange and can transpose directly to the anti-Marshall line if desired by playing Re1 later. Play may also in some rare cases transpose to a traditional closed Spanish (with 7...d6) after something like 6.d3 d6 7.c3 0-0 8.Re1 b5 9.Bc2 Bb7 10.Nbd2 Re8 11.h3 Bf8 12.d4, reaching a reasonably well-trodden position in the Zaitsev system, though both players may deviate at many points in this line.
Also possible is to transpose to the Pilnik Variation, after 6...b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 0-0, where 9.Re1 would transpose to the Pilnik, with the Marshall successfully avoided (which the Pilnik does not do). In general, if 6...b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3, positions could resemble a traditional closed Spanish such as the Zaitsev, Flohr, Smyslov, Karpov, Breyer, or Chigorin where White has played 10.d3 (or in the case of the Chigorin, 11.d3 with 10.Bc2 c5 included) instead of 10.d4 (in the case of the Chigorin, 11.d4) if White plays Re1 and h3. In every case, 10.d3 is far less popular than 10.d4 (again, 11.d4 for Chigorin), but is the only move besides d4 to ever be seriously considered. 10.d3 in those variations are often referred to as the 'quiet' variation of that variation (quiet Breyer, quiet Flohr, quiet Chigorin, etc). In the case of Flohr–Zaitsev-type setups, White may quickly push d3–d4 without h3 and lose a tempo compared to the traditional Zaitsev, but the move h3 is what would be lost, which is not so relevant with the bishop already committed to b7, so the only thing h3 provides isluft(an idea shared with the Pilnik).
In the Averbakh Variation (C87), named forYuri Averbakh, Black defends the threatened e-pawn with 6...d6 instead of driving away the white bishop with the more common 6...b5. This defence shares some similarities with the Modern Steinitz and Russian Defences as Black avoids the ...b5 advance that weakens the queenside. White can reply with either 7.Bxc6 bxc6 8.d4 or 7.c3 Bg4 (it is too late for Black to transpose into the more usual lines of the Closed Defence, because 7...b5 would allow 8.Bc2, saving White a tempo over the two-move sequence Bb3–c2 found in other variations). Thepintemporarily prevents White from playing d2–d4. In response, White can either force d4 with 8.h3 Bh5 9.Bxc6 bxc6 10.d4, or postpone d4 for the time being and play 8.d3 followed by manoeuvering the queen knight to the kingside with Nbd2–f1–g3.
An alternative to 6...d6 is 6...b5 7.Bb3 Bb7. This is known as the Trajković Variation. Black may sacrifice a pawn with 8.c3 d5 9.exd5 Nxd5 10.Nxe5 Nxe5 11.Rxe5 Nf4.
After 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3, Black often plays 7...0-0. White can circumvent the Marshall Attack after 8.c3 d5 and play any of the alternative moves 8.a4, 8.h3, 8.d4, and 8.d3, which are commonly referred to as "anti-Marshall" systems, as they try to deter Black from playing ...d5.
When White opts for 8.c3, Black, in addition to transposing to the main line with 8...d6, can play 8...d5, introducing the Marshall Attack.
One of Black's more aggressive alternatives is the Marshall Attack: after 3...a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 0-0 8.c3 Black plays thegambit8...d5, sacrificing a pawn.  The main line begins with 9.exd5 Nxd5 (9...e4?!, theHerman Steinervariation, is considered weaker) 10.Nxe5 Nxe5 11.Rxe5 c6 (Marshall's original moves, 11...Nf6, and 11...Bb7 are considered inferior, but have also yielded good results at top levels of play for Black. GMJoel Benjaminsuggests that 11...Bb7 is inferior due to 12.Qf3[43]). The resulting position is shown in the diagram. To the casual observer it might seem that Black has been careless and lost a pawn; however, the sacrifice has also stripped off White's kingside defenders, given Black a lead in development, and rendered White's 8.c3 irrelevant. Since Black's compensation is based onpositionalrather thantacticalconsiderations, it is difficult or perhaps impossible to find a refutation. Black generally goes all-in with a massive kingside attack, which has been analysed to great depth (sometimes beyond move 30) with no definite conclusion as to the Marshall's soundness. The Marshall Attack is a very sharp opening system in which a great amount of theoretical knowledge is vital, and many White players, includingGarry Kasparov, avoid it by playing one of the anti-Marshall systems, 8.d4, 8.a4 or 8.h3 instead of 8.c3.[44][41][failed verification]
This gambit became famous whenFrank James Marshallused it as aprepared variationagainstJosé Raúl Capablancain 1918; nevertheless, Capablanca found a way through the complications and won.[42][45]It is often said that Marshall had kept this gambit a secret for use against Capablanca since his defeat in their 1909 match.[46]The most common counterclaim is that Marshall had used a similar approach in 1917 against Walter Frere.[47]However,Edward Winterfound no clear evidence of the date for Frere–Marshall; several games between 1910 and 1918 where Marshall passed up opportunities to use the Marshall Attack against Capablanca; and an 1893 game that used the same line as in Frere–Marshall.[48]
Improvements to Black's play were found (Marshall played 11...Nf6!? originally, but later discovered 11...c6!) and the Marshall Attack was adopted by top players includingBoris Spassky,John Nunn, and more recentlyMichael Adams. In theClassical World Chess Championship 2004, challengerPeter Lekoused the Marshall to win an important game against World ChampionVladimir Kramnik.[49]
Currently, Armenian grandmasterLevon Aronianis one of the main advocates for the Marshall Attack.[50]
The main lines of the Closed Ruy Lopez continue 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 0-0. White can now play 9.d3 or 9.d4, but by far the most common move is 9.h3 which prepares d4 while preventing the awkward pin ...Bg4. This can be considered the main line of the opening as a whole, and thousands of top-level games have reached this position. White aims to play d4 followed by Nbd2–f1–g3, which would firmly support e4 with the bishops on open diagonals and both knights threatening Black's kingside. Black will try to counter this knight manoeuver by expanding on the queenside, taking action in the centre, or putting pressure on e4.
After 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 0-0, we have:
The Pilnik Variation, named forHermann Pilnik, is also known as the Teichmann Variation from the gameTeichmann–Schlechter,Karlsbad1911.[51]White plays 9.d3 intending to later advance to d4 under favourable circumstances. Although d2–d3–d4 appears to lose a tempo compared to d2–d4, White may be able to omit h3 regaining the tempo, especially if Black plays ...Bb7.
The Pilnik has seen a small resurgence in recent years, but that is mainly by transposition through 6.d3, which avoids the Marshall Attack. The line starting with 6.d3 leading to the Pilnik is 6. d3 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 0-0 9. Re1
White usually plays 9.h3 instead of 9.d4 (the Yates Variation) because after 9.d4 Bg4 (the Bogoljubow Variation), the pin of the white king knight is troublesome. The variation takes its name from the gameCapablanca–Bogoljubow, London 1922.[52]
The Chigorin Variation was refined byMikhail Chigorinaround the turn of the 20th century and became the primary Black defence to the Ruy Lopez for more than fifty years. With 9...Na5 Black chases the white bishop from the a2–g8 diagonal and frees the c-pawn for queenside expansion. After 10.Bc2 c5 11.d4 the classical Black follow up is 11...Qc7, reinforcing e5 and placing the queen on the c-file which may later become open after ...cxd4. Other Black moves in this position are 11...Bb7 and 11...Nd7; the latter was adopted byKeresa few times in the 1960s. The Chigorin Variation has declined in popularity because Black must spend some time bringing his offside knight on a5 back into the game.
The Chigorin is divided into fourECOclassifications. In C96, Black or White deviate after 10.Bc2, and do not reach the classical main line position 10...c5 11.d4 Qc7. In C97, White proceeds from the diagram with 12.a4, 12.d5, 12.b4, or the main line 12.Nbd2 when Black responds with ...Be6, ...Rd8, ...Re8, ...Bb7 or ...Bd7. The C98 classification covers 12.Nbd2 Nc6, while C99 covers 12.Nbd2 cxd4 13.cxd4.
The Breyer Variation was recommended byGyula Breyeras early as 1911,[53]but there are no known game records in which Breyer employed this line. The Breyer Variation did not become popular until the 1960s when it was adopted byBoris Spasskyand others. In particular, Spassky's back to back wins overMikhail TalatTbilisiin 1965 did much to enhance its reputation, and Spassky has a career-plus score with the Breyer. The variation was the choice of many top level players as White has had trouble proving an advantage against it. Nowadays, however, this variation is considered too passive, and players prefer to play the Berlin or the Petroff as they seem to equalise more easily.
With 9...Nb8 Black frees the c-pawn and intends to route the knight to d7 where it supports e5. If White fortifies the centre with 10.d3 the opening is classifiedECOcodeC94. The more common continuation, 10.d4, isECOC95. The main line continues 10.d4 Nbd7 11.Nbd2 Bb7 12.Bc2 Re8 13.Nf1 Bf8. Black is threatening to win the e4-pawn via ...exd4 uncovering an attack on the pawn, so White plays 14.Ng3. Black generally plays 14...g6 to stop White's knight from going to f5. White then usually tries to attack the Black queenside via 15.a4. Black seekscounterplayin the centre via 15...c5. White can attack either the kingside or the queenside. This forces resolution of the centre via 16.d5. Black can exploit the weak squares on the queenside via 16...c4. White will try to attack on the kingside via 17.Bg5, moving forces to the kingside. Black will kick the bishop with 17...h6. The logical retreat is 18.Be3, which is met by 18...Nc5. White plays 19.Qd2, forcing 19...h5. The point of this manoeuver was to weaken Black's kingside.
The Zaitsev Variation (also called the Flohr–Zaitsev Variation) was advocated byIgor Zaitsev, who was one ofKarpov'strainers for many years. A Karpov favourite, the Zaitsev remains one of the most important variations of the Ruy Lopez. With 9...Bb7 Black prepares to put more pressure on e4 after 10.d4 Re8 11.Nbd2 Bf8, when play can become very sharp and tactical. One drawback of this line if Black is playing for a win is that White can force Black to choose a different defence or allow adrawbyrepetition of positionwith 11.Ng5 Rf8 12.Nf3. Today the theory in the Zaitsev variations extends beyond the middlegame, and it is rarely seen at the top levels because of the need to remember a lot of theory.
Karpovtried 9...Nd7 several times in the1990 World Championship match, butKasparovachieved a significant advantage against it in the 18th game. It is solid but slightly passive. Confusingly 9...Nd7 is also called the Chigorin Variation so there are two variations of the Ruy Lopez with that name, but 9...Na5 is the move more commonly associated withChigorin. This defence is also known as the Keres Variation, after Paul Keres.
The Kholmov Variation, 9...Be6, was popular in the 1980s but is now played less often at the master level. The main line runs 10.d4 Bxb3 11.axb3 (11.Qxb3 is another option) exd4 12.cxd4 d5 13.e5 Ne4 14.Nc3 f5 15.exf6 Bxf6 16.Nxe4 dxe4 17.Rxe4 Qd5 18.Rg4, when it has been shown that White's extra pawn is more valuable than Black's more active and harmonised pieces.
The Smyslov Variation (ECOC93) is a plan similar to that of the Zaitsev Variation. With 9...h6 Black prepares to play 10...Re8 and 11...Bf8 without fear of 10.Ng5. The loss of a tempo with 9...h6 gives White enough time to complete the Nbd2–f1–g3 manoeuver, and the pawn move can also weaken Black's kingside. The Zaitsev can be considered to be an improved Smyslov in which Black tries to save a tempo by omitting ...h6.
Kasparov played the Smyslov Variation in a loss to theDeep Bluechess computer inGame 2of their1997 Man vs. Machine match.[54]
Svetozar Gligorićhas been the most prolific C93 player.[55]
9...Qd7 is another variation bySmyslov.
Of the variations in this section, the Berlin and Schliemann Defences are the most popular today, followed by the Classical Defence.[56]
and other less-common third moves for Black.
The Cozio Defence (part ofECOC60), 3...Nge7, is distinctly old-fashioned and the least popular of the defences at Black's third move. AlthoughBent Larsenused it occasionally with success, it remains one of the least explored variations of the Ruy Lopez.
The Smyslov Defence, Fianchetto Defence, Barnes Defence, or Pillsbury Defence (part ofECOC60), 3...g6, is a quiet positional system played occasionally byVasily SmyslovandBoris Spassky,[57]becoming popular in the 1980s when it was shown that 4.c3 a6! gives Black a good game.
It was later discovered that 4.d4 exd4 5.Bg5 gives White the advantage, and as such the variation is rarely played today. An interestinggambitline 4.d4 exd4 5.c3 has also been recommended byAlexander Khalifman, although some of the resulting positions have yet to be extensively tested.
Bird's Defence (ECOC61), 3...Nd4,[58]is an uncommon variation in modern praxis. With careful play White is held to gain an advantage. The best moves are 4.Nxd4 exd4 5.0-0 Bc5 6.d3 c6 7.Ba4 Ne7.
This defence was published in 1843 inPaul Rudolf von Bilguer'sHandbuch des Schachspielsand explored byHenry Birdin the late 19th century. Bird played it as Black at least 25 times, scoring +9−13=3 (nine wins, thirteen losses, threedraws).[59]Bird's Defence was later used a few times in tournament play bySiegbert Tarrasch,Boris Spassky, andAlexander Khalifman. Although it is still sometimes seen as a surprise weapon, no strong master since Bird has adopted it regularly.[60]The world championMagnus Carlsenplayed it as Black in the2014 Chess OlympiadagainstIvan Šarićand lost.[61]
The Steinitz Defence (also called the Old Steinitz Defence) (ECOC62), 3...d6, is solid but passive and cramped. Although the favourite of the firstworld championWilhelm Steinitz, and often played by world champions and expert defensive playersEmanuel Lasker,José Capablanca, and occasionally byVasily Smyslov, it largely fell into disuse after World War I, as its inherent passivity spurred a search for more active means of defending the Spanish.
White's most direct approach is 4.d4 immediately challenging Black's pawn on e5, while 4.c3 and 4.0-0 remain viable alternatives. Following 4.d4, Black proceeds with 4...Bd7 which breaks the pin but also defends against White's threat of winning a pawn with 5.Bxc6 and 6.dxe5. Next White plays 5.Nc3 protecting e4 and renewing the threat of winning a pawn to which Black responds with 5...Nf6. After 6.0-0 Be7 7.Re1 Black is forced to concede the centre with 7...exd4, since 7...0-0? leads to theTarrasch Trap.
TheModern Steinitz Defence(3...a6 4.Ba4 d6) offers Black a freer position and is more popular.
The Schliemann Defence or Schliemann–Jaenisch Gambit (ECOC63), 3...f5,[21]is a sharp line in which Black plays for a kingside attack, frequentlysacrificingone or two pawns.  This variation was originated byCarl Jaenischin 1847 and is sometimes named after him.  Although later named for German lawyerAdolf Karl Wilhelm Schliemann(1817–1872), the line Schliemann actually played in the 1860s was a gambit variation of the Cordel Defence (3...Bc5 4.c3 f5).  The most common responses for White to 3...f5!? are 4.d3 or 4.Nc3, with play after 4.Nc3 fxe4 5.Nxe4 going 5...d5, with great complications to follow, or 5...Nf6, which generally leads to quieter play. This line is considered to be a good practical weapon, but is positionally risky, especially against a strong and prepared opponent. In the 1970sJozef Boeyplayed it in the ICCF correspondence chess world championship final and wrote a book about it. It is not a true gambit since if 4.exf5, 4...e4 will force the knight to retreat in which 5...Qg5 prepares to regain the pawn as well as attack g2 and prevent Qh5+.Teimour Radjabovis currently the only top player who regularly employs this line, with mixed results.
The Classical Defence or Cordel Defence (ECOC64), 3...Bc5,[58]is possibly the oldest defence to the Ruy Lopez, and has been played occasionally by formerworld championBoris SpasskyandBoris Gulko. White's most common reply is 4.c3, when Black may choose to play 4...f5, the Cordel Gambit, leading to sharp play, after which 5.d4 is considered the strongest reply. More solid for Black is 4...Nf6, when 5.0-0 0-0 6.d4 Bb6 leads to the Benelux Variation. White's principal alternative to 4.c3 is 4.0-0, when Black can transpose to the Classical Berlin with 4...Nf6 or play 4...Nd4, which is not so bad for Black.
An alternative for White is theforktrick 4.Nxe5. Few games have been played with this line, but there is no clear refutation for Black. The name derives from White's play if Black captures the knight: 4...Nxe5 5.d4.
The Berlin Defence, 3...Nf6,[62]has long had a reputation for solidity and drawishness and is commonly referred to as "theBerlin Wall".[63]The Berlin Defence was played in the late 19th century and early 20th century byEmanuel Laskerand others, who typically answered 4.0-0 with 4...d6 in the style of theSteinitz Defence. This approach ultimately fell out of favour, as had the old form of the Steinitz, due to its passivity, and the entire variation became rare.Arthur Bisguierplayed the Berlin for decades, but always chose the variation 4.0-0 Nxe4. Ever sinceVladimir Kramniksuccessfully used the line as adrawing weaponagainstGarry Kasparovin their2000 World Chess Championshipmatch, the Berlin has experienced a remarkable renaissance: even players with a dynamic style such asAlexei Shirov,Veselin Topalov,Hikaru Nakamura, and Kasparov himself have tried it, andMagnus CarlsenandViswanathan Anandboth used it (Carlsen extensively so) during the2013 World Chess Championshipand2014 World Chess Championship.
Since Black's third move does not threaten to win the e-pawn—if Black captures it, White will win back the pawn on e5[64]—White usuallycastles. After 4.0-0, Black can play either the solid 4...Nxe4 (the Berlin Main Variation) or the more combative 4...Bc5 (the Berlin Classical Variation).[58]After 4...Nxe4 5.d4 Nd6 (5...Be7 is the Rio de Janeiro Variation) 6.Bxc6 dxc6 7.dxe5 Nf5 8.Qxd8+ Kxd8 (l'Hermet Variation), White is considered to have a small advantage from a somewhat better pawn structure and Black's awkwardly placed king. Black, by way of compensation, possesses thebishop pairand has no positional weaknesses, so it is difficult for White to exploit the structural superiority without opening the game for Black's bishops; all four of the games in the Kasparov–Kramnik match in which this line was employed ended in draws.[65][66][67][68]An alternative for Black, though seldom seen since the 1890s, is 6...bxc6 7.dxe5 Nb7, although White keeps an advantage despite Black's two bishops, as it is difficult for Black to gain active counterplay. Despite its drawish tendency, however, theBerlin endgameremains the sternest test of the entire variation beginning with 3...Nf6, and a lot of theory has evolved here. Today's consensus is that Black will hold with accurate play in the Berlin endgame, so players have moved on to the lines with 4.0-0 Nxe4 5.Re1, the modern main line, considered to be White's best try for an opening advantage, and advocated by Fabiano Caruana in his Chessbase Series on the Ruy Lopez opening.
White's move 4.Nc3 transposes to theFour Knights Game, Spanish Variation.
An important alternative is 4.d3, dubbed the Anti-Berlin, which avoids the notorious Berlin endgame.Wilhelm Steinitzscored many spectacular successes with it during his reign as World Champion.[69]The main replies for Black are 4...d6 and 4...Bc5, the latter being more popular. White's most important continuations after 4...Bc5 are 5.0-0, 5.Bxc6, and 5.c3. An uncommon reply to 4.d3 is 4...Ne7, which tries to set up theMortimer Trap.
Another alternative is playing 4.Bxc6 immediately. The main replies for Black are 4...dxc6 and 4...bxc6, the latter of which is playable in the Berlin Defense, unlike theExchange Variationin the Morphy Defense. This may transpose into the Anti-Berlin above if White continues with 5.d3, or in the case of 4...bxc6, to the main line with 5.0-0 Nxe4 or 5.d4 Nxe4, but White has other continuations to 4...bxc6, such as 5.Nc3, and Black has other replies to both 5.0-0 and 5.d4.
The Berlin is assignedECOcodes C65–C67. Code C65 covers alternatives to 4.0-0, including 4.d3 as well as 4.0-0 Bc5. Code C66 covers 4.0-0 d6, while C67 is 4.0-0 Nxe4.

## Scandinavian Defense
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Scandinavian-Defense)
The Scandinavian Defense, formerly better known in English language texts as the Center-Counter, is Black's seventh most popular response to 1.e4.
TheScandinavian Defenseis one of Black's more offbeat responses to White's 1.e4, where Black immediately attacks the white pawn with 1...d5. This is how it got its old name of the Center Counter, because Black immediately counters in the center.
Easily White's best response, and overwhelmingly its most popular, is to capture with 2.exd5. Although it is Black's first move that defines the Scandinavian, the position after that pawn capture is effectively the starting position for the opening. It's at this point where the Scandinavian really gets interesting.
Black has two main second moves: recapturing with 2...Qxd5, or playing 2...Nf6 planning to recapture with the knight. The former of these options breaks the rule, often taught to players just starting out, of not developing the queen too early.
White actually has several reasonable options here, but by far the most common is 3.Nc3, immediately asking Black why the queen exposed herself so soon. The temptation as Black on move three may be to check the white king down the e-file, but this is considered inferior to three main alternatives.
The most common move for Black. Black often plays ...c6 to drop the queen back to c7 at some point, develops the light-squared bishop to f5 or g4 before playing a pawn to e6. The pawns on c6 and e6 create a solid structure for Black. However this is not the only way to play the position; seebelowhow GMViswanathan Anandtreated the opening at the 1995 World Championship.
This move only becomes more popular over time. It is generally more flexible than the other options and Black often obtains an imbalanced position including, if possible, queenside castling. The fact that White can play Nb5 to attack the queen again is not a big deal for Black because it wastes time for White as well.
The oldest move, which is considered passive but playable. Black is just looking to return the queen to safety before setting up the same solid structure, with pawns on c6 and e6, as comes in the 3...Qa5 variations. Black also has the alternative of fianchettoing the dark-squared bishop with ...g6 and ...Bg7 instead of playing ...e6.
If Black does not want to bring the queen out, this is the move to play. White can try to keep the pawn with 3.c4 or continue developing with either 3.Bb5+ or 3.d4. The tradeoff for Black is that while the queen does not come out early, the knight will have to move at least twice to regain the pawn.
The first key to playing against the Scandinavian as White is to always play 2.exd5. Other moves like 2.Nc3 or 2.e5 are playable but only give Black an immediately equal position and are rather easy to meet naturally.
However, White has much more flexibility on move three. Even if Black captures on d5 with the queen, it is not necessary to play 3.Nc3; 3.Nf3 and 3.d4 are also good. In fact, 3.Nf3 scores 47% for White compared to 44% with 3.Nc3. No matter what, however, natural development will give White a fine position.
Otherwise, it's pretty much up to Black how the game will go from there. That ability to play several second and third moves, while White is somewhat limited, is one reason Black plays the opening despite its reputation as inferior. But it's that same reputation that gives White hope. In master play, White wins 44% of master games in the Scandinavian, compared to 40% against the French or 37% against the Sicilian.
The Scandinavian Defense can actually be considered the oldest opening in chess! This is because it is the opening used in the first known recorded game of chess.
Despite its early start, the Scandinavian does not appear in any other known game until 1839.Adolf Anderssentried it twice in his 1858 match againstPaul Morphyand lost both games. Late 19th century masters Joseph Blackburne and Jacques Mieses were the first to employ it semiregularly but the opening has never gained mainstream master acceptance.
In 1995, GM Vishy Anand made history by becoming the first player to try the Scandinavian in a world championship match. He got a good position against GMGarry Kasparovbut could not convert.

Perhaps it is a comment on the strength of the Scandinavian, or lack thereof, that Black has won rather few brilliancies with it over the years. That said, it has definitely had its moments.
GMBent Larsenused it to defeat the world champion GMAnatoly Karpovin 1979.
World champions have also won with the Scandinavian.Jose Capablancadid so a couple times before he was champion, and more recently GMMagnus Carlsenused the 3...Qd8 variation to defeat future championship challenger GMFabiano Caruanaat the 2014Chess Olympiad.

But the most spectacular Scandinavian game on record was a win for White, once again featuring Anand, this time as the victor over GM Joel Lautier.
Although it is difficult to play at the highest levels of chess, for most enthusiasts the Scandinavian is a perfectly playable option for Black. When you are facing a 1.e4 player, they will tend to be more familiar with the Sicilian Defense or 1...e5, and you are likely to know more about 1...d5. And even if you don't want to play it as Black, it is good to be ready for it if you are a 1.e4 player as White.
The Scandinavian will always have a niche in the chess world and is well worth knowing. Learn more about it by exploring ourMaster Gamesdatabase.

## Schliemann Gambit
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/article/view/the-jaenischschliemann-gambit)
Farbror asked:
This is one of my favorite chess quotes:
“Before our first Latvian posting I didn’t care for this gambit one way or the other. Now I hate it with a passion and, when I hit my 80th birthday, fully intend to devote my remaining years in finding one final, catastrophic refutation to this blight on humanity (hopefully someone will beat me to the punch).”
There cannot be too much passion in chess!
Anyhow, suppose I want to play active after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 and would like to stand on more solid ground than “I Like!” What should I look for? The Latvian and the Elephant gambit feel a bit too wild but is the Schliemann gambit (Jaenisch gambit) much better?
Dear Mr. Farbror:
Yes, I did write that several years ago, but it was all in jest. I honestly don’t hate any opening (though I do think quite a few are bad, which I freely say when a chance happens by), and I would hope that, rather than staring at chess moves and thinking of opening vengeance, I’ll spend my time after 80 in the company of dozens of lovely young women or, if my decaying body is no longer a chick magnet, then in some Buddhist monastery in lands far, far away.
I think the Jaenisch/Schliemann Gambit (C63 – 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5!?) is a very interesting system! This anti-Lopez line was first played and explored by the Finnish player Carl Jaenisch around 1847. However, the German player Adolf Schliemann adopted it later and, for some reason, many people named it after him! Oddly, both players died in 1872.
Over the years, I’ve seen refutations to the Jaenisch/Schliemann come and go, but when Radjabov successfully took it up, the opening finally acquired a measure of respectability! Indeed, now it’s occasionally used by giants like Radjabov, Ivan Sokolov, Aronian, Zvjaginsev, Khalifman, Ivanchuk, and even Magnus Carlsen (against Anand)!
In general, White has two good ways to deal with the thing. One is 4.Nc3, which leads to serious complications and loads of theory, while not promising White more than a microscopic edge. The other is 4.d3, a quiet positional line that takes a lot of the fun out of the Jaenisch/Schliemann – it’s still quite playable for Black, but he tends to be on the “struggle” side of a draw.

The viability of this line rests on the possibility of creating opposite color Bishops (by capturing white’s Knight with black’s dark-squared Bishop), which will often allow Black to draw an endgame even if he’s a pawn down.

## Scotch Game
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Scotch-Game)
The Scotch Game is a centuries-old 1.e4 opening for White and one of the best alternatives to the Ruy Lopez. A good opening for beginners, the Scotch is also an excellent weapon for players of every strength level. One of its most prominent adopters was GMGarry Kasparov. Other elite players like GMsVladimir Kramnik, Levon Aronian, andMagnus Carlsenalso have the Scotch as part of their arsenal.
The Scotch Game begins after the moves1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4. White strikes on the center immediately, forcing Black to give up their central e5-pawn. With this move, White virtually guarantees a space advantage. They also avoid the heavy theory of the Ruy Lopez, which is especially advantageous for beginners.
The downside to White's third move lies in the fact that it releases the central tension too early. White will also need to invest another tempo if they want to recapture the pawn after Black takes on d4.
The Scotch Game doesn't have as much theory as other 1.e4 openings like the Ruy Lopez. However, it's still a good idea for players to familiarize themselves with its most popular variations before playing it.
The Schmidt Variation was GMAnatoly Karpov's main option against the Scotch. It occurs after1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6. From here, the game can take positional or tactical depending on the moves the players choose. In this line, Kasparov introduced the idea of exchanging knights on c6 and following it up with the e4-e5 push, creating an imbalanced and rich position.
The Classical Variation starts after1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Nxd4 Bc5. Black immediately puts pressure on White's central knight, forcing their opponent to invest a tempo to either protect the knight or add another defender to it.
The Scotch Gambit happens after the moves1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 Bc4. White ignores the black pawn on d4 to focus on development. Players who want to try this line must be tactically sharp and prepared to focus on activity rather than material to be successful.
The Goring Gambit is an aggressive option for White in the Scotch Gambit. After the moves1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.c3, White gambits a pawn to quickly develop the b1-knight.
White can even offer a second pawn with1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.c3 dxc3 5.Bc4, entering the Double Pawn Sacrifice Variation. Accepting the second pawn is extremely dangerous for Black. White would develop yet another piece and have serious attacking opportunities against the black king.
The Malaniuk Variation happens after1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Nxd4 Bb4+. Black checks the white king to provoke the c2-c3 push since the alternative 5.Nc3 is not ideal for White. The c3-pawn robs the b1-knight's best developing square, making the white pieces' full and active development harder to achieve.
The Scotch Game is a sound way for White to play a 1.e4 e5 opening and avoid the heavy theory of the Ruy Lopez. Below you can see the best-scoring variations for White in the Scotch Game.
The fifth move introduced by Kasparov in his 1990 match defending the title against Karpov helped to popularize the Scotch again. As explained before, White plays1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nxc6, and after 5...bxc6 White pushes the e-pawn. The resulting position leads to a sharp game, with White winning 36% of games, drawing 33%, and losing 31%.
If Black goes for the Classical Variation, White should respond with1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Nxd4 Bc5 5.Nxc6. White wins 37% of games in this position, draws 38%, and loses 25%. After the knight capture, Black can go for 6...bxc6 or the Intermezzo Variation with 6...Qf6, both of which are fine for White.
If you're an attacking player who doesn't mind playing down in material, the Goring Gambit can be an exciting option for you. After1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.c3White wins 44% of games, draws 26%, and loses 32%. Although not common in master-level play, this variation scores very well among club players.

When facing the Scotch, Black must take the d-pawn on the third move. After that, Black has a few reliable options to choose from. Below you can see the best-scoring lines for Black.
The Malaniuk Variation is one of the less-explored but highest-scoring lines for Black. After1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Nxd4 Bb4+Black wins 34% of games, draws 32%, and loses 34%. This line is even more successful among amateurs, with Black outscoring White.

If White goes for the Scotch Gambit, Black's most successful line is the Dubois Réti Defense, which occurs after1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Bc4 Nf6. Black wins 37% in this line, draws 31%, and loses 33%, outscoring White. Amateurs share the same success in this variation, winning more often than losing.
Against the ambitious White player who goes for the Goring Gambit, Black can simply decline the pawn and play1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.c3 d5. Black wins 32%, draws 32%, and loses 36% of games in this line.
The Scotch Game was recorded for the first time by the Italian chess master Ercole del Rio in his 1750 treatise "On the game of Chess, practical Observations by an anonymous Modenese Author." However, the opening got his name for the famous 1824 match between the chess clubs of London and Edinburgh. Three of the games featured the opening, with the Scots winning two of them and drawing the other.
The opening enjoyed vast popularity during the 19th century but fell in decline during the 20th century, as many players considered it lacked strategical depth. However, Kasparov revived the Scotch after playing it in three consecutive World Championship matches in 1990, 1993, and 1995. Today, elite players make use of this opening regularly, including Carlsen.

TheScotch Game, orScotch Opening, is achess openingthat begins with the moves:
Ercole del Rio, in his 1750treatiseSopra il giuoco degli Scacchi, Osservazioni pratiche d’anonimo Autore Modenese("On the game of Chess, practical Observations by an anonymous Modenese Author"), was the first author to mention what is now called the Scotch Game.[1]The opening received its name from acorrespondencematch in 1824 betweenEdinburghandLondon. Popular in the 19th century, by 1900 the Scotch had lost favour among top players because it was thought to release the central tension too early and allow Black toequalisewithout difficulty. In the 20th centurygrandmastersGarry KasparovandJan Timmanhelped to re-popularise the Scotch when they used it as a surprise weapon to avoid the well-analysedRuy Lopez.
White aims to dominate thecentreby exchanging their d-pawn for Black's e-pawn. Black usually plays 3...exd4, as they have no good way of maintaining their pawn on e5 (this same position can be reached bytranspositionfrom the Centre Game 1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.Nf3 Nc6). After 3...d6, White is better after 4.dxe5 dxe5 5.Qxd8+ Kxd8 6.Bc4, or they may simply play 4.Bb5, when 4...exd4 5.Nxd4 Bd7 transposes to theSteinitz Defencein the Ruy Lopez.
3...Nxd4 theLolli Variationis possible, though rarely played today by strong players. It was popular in the 19th century, and receives five columns of analysis in Freeborough and Ranken's opening manualChess Openings Ancient and Modern(3rd ed. 1896 p. 53). It is often described today as a strategic error, since after 4.Nxd4 exd4 5.Qxd4 (5.Bc4 is theNapoleon Gambit) White'squeenstands on a central square, and isnotdeveloped too early since it cannot be chased away very effectively (5...c5?is a seriously weakening move that blocks Black'sking's bishop). Nonetheless, theEncyclopaedia of Chess Openings(ECO) concludes that Blackequaliseswith 5...Ne7 6.Bc4 Nc6 7.Qd5 Qf6 8.0-0 Ne5 9.Be2 c6 10.Qb3 Ng6 11.f4 Bc5+ 12.Kh1 d6 (I. Sokolov).[2]Similarly, Harald Keilhack concludes inKnight on the Left: 1.Nc3(p. 21) that although ...Nxd4 is a "non-line" these days, if Black continues perfectly it is not clear that White gets even a small advantage. Keilhack analyses 5.Qxd4 d6 6.Nc3 Nf6 7.Bc4 Be7 8.0-0 0-0 9.Bg5 c6 10.a4 Qa5 11.Bh4 and now after 11...Qe5 or 11...Be6, "White has at most this indescribable nothingness which is theadvantage of the first move." (Id.p. 25) TheECOalso concludes that Black equalises after the alternative 4.Nxe5 Ne6 5.Bc4 Nf6 6.Nc3 Be7 7.0-0 0-0 8.Be3 d6 9.Nd3 Nxe4 10.Nxe4 d5 (Parma).[3]The main line 3...exd4 4.Nxd4 may transpose into this position if Black chooses to play 4...Nxd4.
3...d6?is often regarded as a mistake and an automatic slight advantage for White. While 3...d6 does defend the e5-pawn, it allows White to play 4.d5 and kick out the knight. The resulting line of 4...Nce7 5.c4 Nf6 6.Nc3 Ng6 allows White an imposing centre and better chances for winning. Opting to take on e5 still scores poorly for Black, as 4.dxe5 dxe5 5.Qxd8+ leaves Black in a losing dilemma: either take with the king and forgo castling rights (5...Kxd8), or to take with the c6-knight and lose the e5-pawn (5...Nxd8 6.Nxe5).Chess.comcites a meager 18% win rate for Black's 3...d6 move.
3...f5?!4.Nxe5 transposes into a line of the dubiousLatvian Gambit.
After the usual 3...exd4, White can respond with the main line 4.Nxd4 or can play agambitby offering Black one or two pawns in exchange for rapiddevelopment.
After 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4, the most important continuations are:
In the main line after 4.Nxd4, Black has two major options. Either 4...Bc5 or 4...Nf6 offers Black good chances for an equal game.
After 4...Bc5 White has 5.Be3, 5.Nxc6, or 5.Nb3.
On 5.Be3 play almost always continues 5...Qf6 6.c3 Nge7 7.Bc4 (as proposed byIMGary LaneinWinning with the Scotch; several seventh move alternatives for White are possible here, 7.g3 for example) 7...Ne5 seems Black's strongest reply. Play usually continues 8.Be2 (white allows Ne5 with tempo to enable a potential f4 counter). 8... Qg6 (8...d5 is also possible) 9.0-0. Here, White allows Black the option of taking the unprotected pawn on e4, but it is considered "poisoned".[4]) 8.0-0 Bb6 where the position is roughly equal.
After 5.Nxc6, play almost always continues 5...Qf6 (Black does not lose a piece on c6 because he is threatening mate with 6...Qxf2) 6.Qd2 dxc6 7.Nc3, or 6.Qf3 dxc6 followed by either 7.Bc4 or 7.Nc3.
On 5.Nb3 play almost always continues 5...Bb6 6.Nc3, or alternatively 5...Bb6 6. a4 a6 7.Nc3. After 6.Nc3, White usually follows with (in some order) Qe2, Be3 or Bg5.
After 4...Nf6 White has 5.Nxc6 (theMieses Variation) or 5.Nc3 (theScotch Four Knights Game). After 5.Nc3 almost always played is 5...Bb4 6.Nxc6 bxc6 7.Bd3 d5 8.exd5 cxd5 9.0-0 0-0 10.Bg5 c6. After 5.Nxc6 bxc6 6.e5 Qe7 7.Qe2 Nd5 8.c4 is also very common. Where these main lines end, the first real opening decisions are made, which are too specific for this overview.
Steinitz's4...Qh4!? almost wins a pawn by force, but White gets a lead in development and attacking chances as compensation. As of 2005, White's most successful line has been 5.Nc3 Bb4 6.Be2 Qxe4 7.Nb5 Bxc3+ 8.bxc3 Kd8 9.0-0, from which Black's awkwardly placed king has generally proven more significant than the extra pawn.
Instead of 4.Nxd4, White has two ways to offer a gambit. TheScotch Gambitstarts with 4.Bc4. The Scotch Gambit may also be reached via theItalian Gambitby 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.d4 exd4; however, this move order gives Black the option of avoiding the Scotch with 4...Bxd4. After 4.Bc4, Black can transpose into the 4.d4 exd4 line of theTwo Knights Defencewith 4...Nf6, or continue 4...Bc5, when White has three main options.
The Black response 4...Bb4+ to the Scotch Gambit is called the London Defence.[8]
TheGöring Gambitis a relative of theDanish Gambitwhich starts with 4.c3. White sacrifices one or two pawns in return for a lead in development, and typically follows up by putting pressure on f7 with Bc4, Qb3 and sometimes Ng5, while Nc3–d5 is another common motif. TheOxford Companion to Chessnotes that the gambit was first played at high levels byHoward Stauntonin the 1840s, and the earliest game with it was probably played in 1843.[9]The first game with the gambit accepted may be Meek–Morphy, New York 1857.[10]Carl Theodor Göringintroduced it into master play in 1872, but while Göring's name is most often associated with the one-pawn gambit (5.Nxc3), Göring invariably used the double-pawn gambit with 5.Bc4. The gambit has been played byLjubomir Ljubojević,David Bronstein,Frank Marshall, andJonathan Penrose. In casual games,Alexander Alekhineoften transposed to it via the move order 1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3, when ...Nc6 for Black and Nf3 for White often followed. In general, the opening is unpopular at master level but is more popular at club level. It is recommended to study the Göring Gambit in connection with the Danish.
Black can equalise by transposing to the Danish Declined with 4...d5, when the critical line runs 5.exd5 Qxd5 6.cxd4 Bg4 7.Be2 Bb4+ 8.Nc3 Bxf3 9.Bxf3 Qc4 (or 6...Bb4+ 7.Nc3 Bg4 8.Be2 Bxf3 9.Bxf3 Qc4, leading to the same position), often referred to as the Capablanca Variation in view of the strength of Black's concept in the game Marshall–Capablanca, Lake Hopatcong 1926.[11]This line (which can also arise from theChigorin Defenceto the Queen's Gambit),[12]forcing White to either exchange queens or forgo the right tocastlewith the risky 10.Be3, deters many players from employing this gambit. Equal endgames result after either 10.Qb3 Qxb3 11.axb3 Nge7 or 10.Bxc6+ bxc6 11.Qe2+ Qxe2+ 12.Kxe2 Ne7. If Black avoids steering for Capablanca's ending, e.g. with 6...Nf6 or 7...0-0-0 in the above lines, then White obtains good piece play in return for the isolated d-pawn. White can deviate with 6...Bg4 7.Nc3, with the idea of meeting 7...Bb4 with 8.a3 (or 6...Bb4+ 7.Nc3 Bg4 8.a3)[13]or the rare 5.Bd3,[14]neither of which promise an advantage but which avoid those endings.
Black can also decline with 4...Nf6, transposing to a line of thePonziani Opening. The continuation 5.e5 Ne4 was endorsed byDangerous Weapons, 1.e4 e5(Everyman Chess, 2008), butTim Hardingconsiders 5...Nd5 a better try for equality,[15]when White can continue 6.Bb5 a6 7.Ba4 Nb6 8.Bb3, 6.Qb3, 6.Bc4 or 6.cxd4. Another possibility is 4...Nge7 intending 5...d5, when the critical continuation is 5.Bc4 d5 6.exd5 Nxd5 7.0-0. According to IMJohn Watson, Black may be able to equalise with 7...Be7.[16]Declining with 4...d3, however, allows White some advantage after 5.Bxd3 d6 6.Bf4 Be7 7.h3 Nf6 8.Nbd2 Bd7 9.Qc2 according toBatsford Chess Openings 2.
If Black accepts the gambit with 4...dxc3, White can commit to sacrificing only one pawn with 5.Nxc3. Black's most critical response is generally considered to be 5...Bb4,[17]when White does not get enough compensation after 6.Bc4 d6 7.0-0 Bxc3 8.bxc3 Nf6!, when 9.Ba3 Bg4 is insufficient and 9.e5 Nxe5 10.Nxe5 dxe5 11.Qb3 (11.Qxd8+ Kxd8 12.Bxf7 Ke7 is also good for Black) 11...Qe7 12.Ba3 c5 does not give enough compensation for two pawns. White can deviate with 7.Qb3, when the old main line runs 7...Qe7 8.0-0 Bxc3, and here 9.Qxc3 gives White good compensation. Thus both John Watson and USCF master Mark Morss recommend 7...Bxc3+, in order to meet 8.Qxc3 with 8...Qf6! when White loses too much time with the queen. Thus White often continues 8.bxc3 when 8...Qe7 9.0-0 Nf6 can be met by 10.e5 (transposing back to lines arising from 7.0-0 Bxc3 8.bxc3 Nf6 9.e5, though these are insufficient for White) or the relatively unexplored 10.Bg5. Other deviations for White include 7.Ng5 and 6.Bg5.[18]
Black's main alternative is 5...d6, which usually leads to complications and approximately equal chances after 6.Bc4 Nf6 7.Qb3 Qd7 8.Ng5 Ne5 9.Bb5 c6 10.f4, or 7.Ng5 Ne5 8.Bb3 h6 9.f4. 5...Bc5 is also playable, transposing to the Scotch Gambit after 6.Bc4 but cutting out the Bxf7+ possibility. 5...Nf6 6.Bc4 can transpose back to 5...d6 lines after 6...d6, or Black can attempt to transpose to 5...Bb4 lines with 6...Bb4, but this allows 7.e5 d5 8.exf6 dxc4 9.Qxd8+ Nxd8 10.fxg7 Rg8 11.Bh6.
Alternatively, White can transpose into the Danish by offering a second pawn with 5.Bc4 cxb2 6.Bxb2, an approach whichJohn Emmsconsiders far more dangerous for Black. If Black does not accept the second pawn with 5...cxb2, then White can avoid Black's most critical response to 5.Nxc3 (5...Bb4 6.Bc4 d6). For instance, after 5...d6, White's best is 6.Nxc3, transposing back to the 5.Nxc3 d6 line. 5...Nf6 6.Nxc3 transposes to the 5.Nxc3 Nf6 line, 5...Bb4 is well met by 6.0-0 or 6.bxc3 (transposing to the Scotch Gambit), 5...Bc5 also transposes to the Scotch Gambit while 5...Be7?! (which is well met by 6.Qd5) transposes to theHungarian Defence.
Thus Black's most critical response is to take the second pawn with 5...cxb2 6.Bxb2. Unlike in the Danish proper, having committed thequeen's knightto c6, Black cannot safely meet 6.Bxb2 with 6...d5.[19]Instead, play often continues 6...d6 7.0-0 Be6 8.Bxe6 fxe6 9.Qb3 Qd7 or 7.Qb3 Qd7 8.Bc3 Nh6. 6...Bb4+ is the main alternative for Black, whereupon an approach withqueensidecastling is considered dangerous for Black, e.g. 7.Nc3 Nf6 8.Qc2 d6 9.0-0-0.

TheSemi-Slav Defenseis a variation of theQueen's Gambit Declinedchess openingdefined by the position reached after the moves:
The position may readily be reached by a number of differentmove orders. Black's supporting pawns resemble a mixture of the OrthodoxQueen's Gambit Declined, e6, and theSlav Defense, c6.
Black is threatening to capture the whitepawnon c4 and hold it with ...b7–b5. White can avoid this in a number of ways. About 80% of games continue 5.Bg5 or 5.e3: the former constitutes a sharp pawn sacrifice, while the latter restricts the dark-squared bishop from its naturaldevelopmentto g5. Other possible moves are 5.Qb3, 5.g3 and 5.cxd5, the last of which, after 5...exd5, leads to a line of the QGD Exchange Variation where White's early Nf3 enables Black's queen bishop to freely develop, which should give equality (ECOcodes D43 and D45). 5.Bf4 is considered somewhat inaccurate, as 5...dxc4 is favorable for Black.
The Semi-Slav is designated by codes D43 through D49 inEncyclopaedia of Chess Openings.
It is possible to reach the Semi-Slav through many move orders. White may start the game with either 1.d4, 1.Nf3 or even 1.c4, keeping the possibility of a Semi-Slav open. Black can choose different combinations of ...d5, ...c6, ...e6 and ...Nf6 as well in order to avoid certain variations or to open up some new opportunities of his own. This chapter looks at the first moves of the game from Black's point of view, assuming that he would prefer to play the Semi-Slav.
If White opens the game with 1.d4, Black is happy to respond with 1...d5 when aiming for a Semi-Slav. Of course White can continue the game with 2.Bf4 or even 2.Bg5 (as is the case if Black opens 1...Nf6), and the game will take a completely different path. In vast majority of master games, however, White players choose to play either 2.c4 (Queens Gambit) or 2.Nf3. After 2.Nf3, the natural continuation for Black is 2...Nf6. Playing 2...c6 or 2...e6 might be somewhat inaccurate, since White always has the option of avoiding c2–c4, so developing the knight first makes a lot of sense.
If White chooses the most common 2.c4, Black has three practical choices: either protect the pawn on d5 by playing e6 or c6 (keeping the option of a Semi-Slav open), or alternatively capture the white pawn with dxc4 (leading to Queen's Gambit Accepted). The first thing for Black players to consider is, what if White captures on d5 anyhow with cxd5. If Black has played the Slav move order (2...c6), then after the recapture cxd5 ("exchange Slav") the pawn structure is symmetrical. Should Black have played 2...e6 instead, the recapture exd5 leads to an imbalanced pawn structure called the Carlsbad structure, which might offer White some opportunities for a minority attack on thequeenside.
Protecting the d5-pawn with the c-pawn has at least three implications for Black. First, it allows Black to keep the option to enter the Slav Defense, i.e., developing his light-squared bishop to f5 at the appropriate moment, before moving his e-pawn. Second, it may discourage White from capturing on d5, given the somewhat drawish reputation of the Exchange Slav. Third, it prevents White from entering the Catalan opening with 3.g3.
One drawback of playing 2...c6 is that White may continue 3.Nf3, and after 3...Nf6 play 4.e3 ("Slow Slav"), and now Black cannot really play the Semi-Slav since 4...e6 is considered to be good for White as he has not committed to Nc3 thus having other options to develop, for example Nbd2 or b3.
Protecting the d5-pawn with the e-pawn allows Black to develop hiskingsidemore rapidly, but it does block the light-squared bishop for the time being. After 3.Nf3 Nf6 White has the option of entering the Catalan opening with 4.g3.
If White continues 3.Nc3, Black has two options to proceed with a Semi-Slav in mind. First, Black can play 3...c6 (the "triangle setup", see below). Second, Black can play 3...Nf6, which gives White the opportunity to continue 4.cxd5 exd5 followed by 5.Bg5.
After the move order 1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nc3 Black has the opportunity to respond with 3...e6 instead of 3...Nf6. This "triangle setup" opens up some new alternatives for both players on the fourth move.
First, White has the opportunity to enter the Marshall Gambit by playing 4.e4. Play continues 4...dxe4 (4...Bb4 is sometimes played, but should favor White) 5.Nxe4 Bb4+. Now White has two alternative paths to continue. The main line is considered to be 6.Bd2 Qxd4 7.Bxb4 Qxe4+ and then White blocks the check with either his knight or bishop. Alternatively White can continue with 6.Nc3 (as in World Championship match Carlsen–Anand, 2013), and play continues 6...c5 7.a3 Ba5.
Second, if White continues 4.Nf3, Black has the extra option of playing 4...dxc4 entering the Noteboom Variation. If White wants to avoid this variation, he must play either 4.e4 (Marshall Gambit) or 4.e3 (which usually transposes to the Meran, but deprives White of the Bg5 variations). White now has a number of possible continuations, including 5.a4 (see below), 5.e3 (often transposing to the line given below), 5.e4 (with similarities to the line given below), or even 5.Bg5. A typical line in the Noteboom Variation continues: 5.a4 Bb4 6.e3 b5 7.Bd2 a5 8.axb5 Bxc3 9.Bxc3 cxb5 10.b3 Bb7 11.bxc4 b4 12.Bb2 Nf6 13.Bd3 Nbd7 14.0-0 0-0 with an interesting position where Black has two connected passed pawns on the queenside, while White has the bishop pair and dominates the center of the board.
The "triangle setup" is not ideal for Black if White plays 3.Nf3 instead of 3.Nc3. Should Black play 3...e6 nevertheless, White has the option of continuing with 4.e3 or 4.Qc2, for example, thus avoiding the Noteboom Variation.
Black has the option of delaying the move ...d7–d5, for instance to avoid the exchange cxd5. If White continues 3.Nc3, Black has the option of transposing to a Nimzo-Indian with 3...Bb4. Should White choose to play 3.Nf3 instead, Black can simply play 3...d5, and then after 4.Nc3 c6 we are back at the start of the Semi-Slav. This move order, however, allows White to play the Catalan Opening with either 3.g3, or alternatively 3.Nf3 d5 4.g3.
Roughly 50% of the games continue with 5.e3. White gives priority to developing his light-squared bishop, and accepts that for the time being the dark-squared bishop will remain somewhat out of play. The main line continues with 5...Nbd7. 5...Be7 is rare, as the bishop is passively placed on e7 and does not support the freeing move ...e5. The unusual move 5...a6 is considered solid for Black. Some sources call 5...a6 the "accelerated Meran".[1]
One of the main variations of the Semi-Slav is the Meran Variation. White plays 6.Bd3, provoking the continuation 6...dxc4 7.Bxc4 b5 (ECOcodes D46 to D49) where black surrenders his center in exchange for queenside expansion and some tempo against the white bishop. The line was first played in 1906 in the game Schlechter–Perlis.[2]The variation takes its name from the town of Meran (Merano) in northern Italy. During a 1924 tournament in Meran, it was used successfully in the gameGruenfeld–Rubinstein. Gruenfeld adopted the same variation two rounds later againstSpielmann, winning as well.[3]White will play in the center, leading to a rich, complicated game. These opposing strategies, with the ensuing keen play, have long made the Meran a favorite for enterprising players of either color. An example is Gligoric–Ljubojevic, Belgrade 1979.[4]
Though appearing in contemporary master play with less frequency than the Meran, there are other possibilities: 6...Be7, 6...Bb4, introduced by the Italian masterMax Romih, and 6...Bd6, which was much the most popular line before the debut of the Meran, and espoused by the AmericangrandmasterArthur Bisguierthroughout his career.
After the main line 6.Bd3 dxc4 7.Bxc4 b5 White has three alternative retreats for the bishop. The vast majority of games continue 8.Bd3, but the moves 8.Bb3 and 8.Be2 are also possible.
By playing 8.Bd3 White returns the bishop on this ideal square, where it supports White's strategic ambition of pushing e3–e4 in the near future, and gives White the option of playing Ne4 if necessary. Black's main plan, on the other hand, is to find a way to push ...c6–c5 in order to free the long diagonal for his light-squared bishop and to eliminate the backward pawn on the semi-open c-file. In practice, Black has three alternative moves in this position: 8...a6 (Classical Meran), 8...Bb7 ("Modern/Improved Meran"[5]) or 8...Bd6 (which often transposes to the lines of the Anti-Meran).
Maintaining the bishop on the long diagonal aiming at e6- and f7-squares is an aggressive approach by White. If Black is not careful, White will launch an aggressive attack towards the black king with possible knight sacrifices on e6 or f7 in the near future. An example continuation might be 8...b4 9.Ne2 Bb7 10.Nf4 Bd6 11.Ng5, when White is already threatening sacrifices to open up Black's position, and Black must respond with 11...Bxf4 in order to avoid trouble.
Retreating the bishop to e2 instead of the typical d3-square has an impact on certain continuations, when the white queen is protecting the d-pawn. An example can be seen in a line where Black plays in the typical Meran style: 8.Be2 a6 9.e4 c5 10.e5 cxd4 and now White has the option of playing 11.Qxd4 Bc5 12.Qf4 with a comfortable advantage.
Black plays 8...a6 in order to protect his b5-pawn and threatening to follow up with the equalizing move ...c6–c5. White cannot really prevent this plan directly, so he must immediately generate some counterplay in the center with 9.e4. It is also possible to play 9.a4, but 9.0-0 is a strategic mistake as it allows Black to freely push his c-pawn, equalizing immediately. Black will respond with 9...c5, after which White has the choice between pushing his d-pawn or e-pawn, leading to very different middlegames.
Pushing the e-pawn is the classical approach by White, adopted in several high-level games, including World Championship match Kramnik–Anand in 2008. The black knight on f6 has no reasonable squares to go to, so Black must continue his aggression by 10...cxd4, attacking the white knight in return. Taking the knight on f6 would favor Black, so White responds 11.Nxb5 (the Blumenfeld Variation), sacrificing his knight while still threatening Black's f6-knight. Black now has three reasonable alternatives for how to proceed. The most popular and tested line continues 11...axb5 12.exf6 gxf6 13.0-0 Qb6 14.Qe2 with a very interesting position. Black is up a pawn and has a very straightforward plan: play ...Bb7, ...Bd6, ...Rb8 and aim for the white king. Practice has shown, however, that White is doing very well in these positions, but precision is certainly required from both sides. Alternatively, Black can play 11...Ng4 (the Rabinovich Variation), where White might respond 12.Qa4, preventing the capture ...axb5 due to the pin on the a-file, as well as discouraging Black from capturing on e5 due to the discovered check on the black king. Nevertheless, play might continue 12...Ngxe5 13.Nxe5 Nxe5 14.Nd6+ Ke7 15.Nxc8+ Rxc8 16.Bxa6 Ra8 and White is clearly better but certainly not yet winning. A third alternative is to play 11...Nxe5 (the Sozin Variation), and after 12.Nxe5 axb5 13.Bxb5+ Bd7 14.Nxd7 Qa5+ 15.Bd2 Qxb5 16.Nxf8 Kxf8 White probably has a slight advantage, but the imbalance in pawn structures will guarantee an exciting game with opportunities for both sides.
White has the option of playing 10.d5 as well. This often transposes to the Reynolds Attack (described in detail below) after, for example, 10...c4 11.Bc2 Qc7 12.0-0 Bb7, or another move order.
According to some sources, the move was first played in 1923. The strategic idea behind this move is to develop the light-squared bishop and possibly play b5–b4 and c6–c5 without wasting time on a7–a6. The move 8...Bb7 was long considered virtually unplayable due to the line 9.e4 b4 10.Na4 c5 11.e5 Nd5 12.Nxc5 Nxc5 13.dxc5 Bxc5 14.Bb5+ and the black king will be stuck in the center. However, it was later found, in particular through the work of Danish grandmaster Bent Larsen in the late 1960s and early 1970s, that after 14...Ke7 Black is completely fine and might be even better, with a very strong knight on d5 and strong bishops aiming at the White kingside. This forced White players to look for alternative approaches to Black's modern treatment of the Meran.
White can simply play 9.0-0, and the game often continues 9...a6 10.e4 c5 11.d5 leading into the Reynolds Attack. 11.e5 is no longer an option as it was in the Classical Meran, since Black can respond with 11...cxd4 and now 12.Nxb5 no longer works since Black has the option of playing 12...Bxf3 13.Qxf3 Nd5 withequality. After 11.d5 Black cannot really capture on d5, since the opening of the e-file could be disastrous for Black in a practical game (although with precise computer play Black seems to be fine after 11...exd5). Therefore, Black must allow White to capture on e6, and try to deal with the consequences.
Black typically develops his queen with ...Qc7, with the choice of whether or not to push the c-pawn to c4. The benefit of pushing the c-pawn is that should White play dxe6 and after the recapture fxe6 attack the e-pawn with either Ng5 or Nd4, Black has the opportunity to defend the pawn with ...Nc5. Alternatively, Black can refrain from pushing the c-pawn to c4, which prevents White from using the d4-square for his knight in some variations.
An example variation where Black keeps his c-pawn on c5 is: 11...Qc7 12.dxe6 fxe6 13.Ng5 Qc6 after which there are many different ways to continue for both sides.
If Black instead pushes his c-pawn, this opens up several interesting opportunities for White. For example: 11...c4 12.Bc2 Qc7 13.dxe6 fxe6 and now White has two possible knight moves (among other alternatives) pressure Black's e-pawn.
First, 14.Ng5 has to be met with 14...Nc5 (now 14...Qc6 would lead to 15.Qf3 h6 16.Qh3 – a typical queen maneuver in such positions – with a very strong advantage for White). Now White has a couple of interesting alternatives to proceed. The first one is a flashy move 15.e5, played for example in 1994 by Kramnik against Shirov, and a couple of rounds later by Karpov against Kramnik himself. Play continues 15...Qxe5 16.Re1 Qd6 17.Qxd6 Bxd6 18.Be3 0-0 19.Rad1 Be7 20.Bxc5 Bxc5 21.Nxe6 Rfc8 with roughly equal chances for both. An alternative approach is 15.Be3 h6, after which White can throw in the even flashier knight sacrifice 16.Nxe6, and the game typically continues 16...Nxe6 17.e5 Qxe5 18.Bg6+ (the point!) Ke7 19.Re1 and White has a strong attack against the black king, despite being a full piece down.
Second, 14.Nd4 Nc5 15.Qe2 Bd6 leads to very interesting play, for example in the game Karpov–Anand, 1998, which continued 16.f4 e5 17.Ndxb5 axb5 18.Nxb5 Qb6 19.Nxd6+ Qxd6 20.fxe5 Qxe5 21.Rf5 Qe7 22.Qxc4 Rc8 23.Qb5+ Ncd7 24.Qxb7 Rxc2 with a wild and tactical game.
A lot of theory and high-level games exist on Reynolds Attack and its different subvariations. As in many variations of the Semi-Slav, the game becomes wildly tactical and provides opportunities for both sides.
Continuing the game with 9.e4 b4 10.Na4 c5 11.e5 Nd5 is still very much an option for White. Instead of captures on c5, White can play 12.0-0 with some attacking prospects. The most critical continuation is 12...cxd4, after which White can either play 13.Re1 or 13.Nxd4, both giving opportunity for some wild attacks on the black position. With accurate play, however, Black should be fine.
White has a third option to play 9.a3 as well. The idea is to prepare b2–b4 by White, which would make it more difficult for black to achieve his strategic plan of pushing c6–c5. Black may respond with moves like 9...b4, 9...Bd6, 9...a6 or 9...a5.
Intent of the move 8...Bd6 is to allow rapid castling as well as to increase Black's control over the e5-square, which will be critical in many continuations. White's strategic idea in the Meran is to push e3–e4, and with a bishop on d6 Black is always ready to meet this with e6–e5, and typically Black is doing fine after such moves. Play might continue 9.0-0 0-0 10.Qc2 Bb7 transposing to one of the topical lines discussed in the Anti-Meran section below. In addition there are some independent lines after 8...Bd6, where play continues with, for example, either 9.Ng5 Bb7 10.Qf3 h6 11.Qh3 or 9.Bd2 Bb7 10.Rc1 Rc8 11.a3.
Also known as the Stoltz Variation, named after Swedish grandmasterGösta Stoltz, the main alternative to 6.Bd3 has become 6.Qc2. Once a sideline, this move exploded in popularity in the 1990s, in large part due toAnatoly Karpov's advocacy. The idea is to wait for Black to commit to ...dxc4 before playing Bd3. Black commonly replies with 6...Bd6. One such example was played betweenMagnus CarlsenagainstViswanathan AnandatLinaresin 2009, in which the white pieces ended victorious.[6]
White can choose between a couple of very different continuations:
Most often White players choose the move 7.Bd3. Karpov first played 7.Be2 but it soon transpired that the d3-square gives White better chances. Play usually continues 7...dxc4 8.Bxc4 0-0 9.0-0 b5 10.Bd3 Bb7, after which White has several interesting options to continue the game.
One of the "hot" positions of Semi-Slav occurs after 11.a3. White intends to simply push b2–b4, which would seriously hamper Black's strategic plan of playing c6–c5. White also often looks at transferring his knight from f3 via g5 to e4, which is something Black might want to prevent. Black players have tried various approaches to combat White's plan, and the final word on this variation has certainly not yet been said.
If Black responds with 11...a5, he is certainly slowing down White's intentions towards b4, but the cost may be too high: Black will never be able to support his b-pawn with a6, and the weakness of the queenside pawn structure will be a permanent problem.
An alternative is to play 11...a6 aiming at pushing c5 next, which more or less invites White to play 12.b4. Now Black can respond with 12...a5, and the game could continue with 13.Rb1 axb4 14.axb4 Qe7 15.e4 e5, with very dynamic play and opportunities for both sides.
Playing 11...Qe7 takes the poison out of White's planned knight transfer, since after the moves 12.Ng5 h6 13.Nge4 Nxe4 14.Nxe4 c5 Black seems to be fine. However, after 11...Qe7, White can continue 12.e4 e5 13.Bg5, and White seems to retain some advantage.
A very radical approach by Black is to play 11...Rc8, with a clear threat of placing the rook on the same file as the white queen. If White now plays 12.b4 to "prevent" Black from pushing the c-pawn, Black may simply respond with 12...c5!? (12...a5 is the computer preference), and after 13.bxc5 Bxf3 14.cxd6 Nd5 the game is wide open with massive tactical complications and opportunities for both sides.
Playing 11.Rd1 is a possibility, but it looks like Black can neutralize White's play after 11...b4 12.Na4 c5 13.dxc5 Rc8 and the tactics seem to work in Black's favor.
White can immediately push 11.e4, and Black must respond with the thematic 11...e5. Play often continues 12.dxe5 Nxe5 13.Nxe5 Bxe5 14.h3 with some slight advantage for White.
White can begin the thematic knight transfer immediately with 11.Ng5. In such positions, Black often has the tactical idea of Bxh2+ Kxh2 Ng4+ at his disposal, but in this precise variation it does not seem to provide anything for Black. After 11...h6 12.Nge4 Be7 the position seems very equal, though.
Instead of preparing the e3–e4 push to free his dark-squared bishop, White can also play 7.b3 to support the pawn on c4 and develop the bishop on the long diagonal in anticipation of future opening of the center. Play might continue 7...0-0 8.Be2 after which Black has several viable continuations at his disposal, with the most common being 8...b6 and 8...e5.
Another increasingly common gambit line used in the Anti-Meran is the sharp 7.g4. Popularized byAlexander ShabalovandAlexey Shirov, the gambit destabilizes the center for Black and has been successful for severalgrandmasters, includingKasparov, who won the first game of his2003 matchagainst the computer chess programDeep Juniorwith it.[7]
If Black simply takes the pawn with 7...Nxg4, White will respond with 8.Rg1. Black now has a number of playable continuations, including Qf6, Nxh2, f5, h5 and Nh6, and with precise play Black should be fine.
An alternative to taking the pawn is to simply stop it by playing 7...h6. White will continue with 8.Rg1 anyhow, but Black has a number of playable responses.
Another popular response is to play 7...dxc4, but after 8.Bxc4 it seems that White will retain a slight advantage. Play might continue, for example, with 8...e5 9.g5 Nd5 10.Ne4
The Anti-Meran Gambit (ECOcode D44) arises after 5.Bg5. White refuses to shut in the dark-squared bishop, instead developing it to an active square where itpinsthe black knight. The downsides of this choice are that it does not help developing White's kingside, and the pawn of c4 remains unprotected. In some cases, such as the Cambridge Springs Defense (see below), Black aims to benefit from the slight dark square weaknesses left behind on the queenside after the bishop has moved outside the pawn chain.
Main Black replies are (in order of frequency in high-level games): 5...h6 (immediately questioning the white bishop's intentions, leading to Moscow/Anti-Moscow variations), 5...Nbd7 (transposing to theCambridge Springs Defense), 5...dxc4 (triggering the ultra-sharp Botvinnik Variation) or 5...Be7 (transposing to theOrthodox Defenseof the Queen's Gambit Declined).
The Moscow Variation 5...h6 6.Bxf6 Qxf6 gives rise to play of a very different character from the Botvinnik or Anti-Moscow Variations. Black has the bishop pair, which gives him good long-term chances, but must avoid prematurely opening the position in the face of White's superior development and central control, as his position is initially solid but passive.Alexei Dreev, for example, has played this line successfully as Black.
Play might continue like this: 7.e3 Nd7 8.Bd3 dxc4 (White was threatening to play e3–e4–e5) 9.Bxc4 g6 (9...Bd6 is also possible) 10.0-0 Bg7 and now there are various ways to continue the game for both sides. Black has the bishop pair and no immediate structural weaknesses, but his pieces are still a bit undeveloped, especially the light-squared bishop. White might continue with a queenside expansion, for example 11.b4 0-0 12.a4 with a lively game to follow. An alternative approach is one introduced in a game Carlsen–Karjakin (2009), where White continued with the thematic 11.e4 e5 12.d5 Nb6 13.Bb3 Bg4. This allows Black to inflict doubled pawns for White, but it seems that White is able to get a lot of play against Black's weak c-pawn. The game continued: 14.Rc1 0-0 15.h3 Bxf3 16.Qxf3 Qxf3 17.gxf3 Rfd8 18.Rfd1 Bf6 19.dxc6 bxc6 20.Rxd8+ Rxd8 21.Nd1 and White seems to have a slight advantage.
In order to avoid the continuations above, Black can also play 7...g6 instead. This makes White's typical plan of e3–e4–e5 a bit less attractive (an example line could be: 8.Bd3 Bg7 9.e4 0-0 10.0-0 Qd8 11.e5 dxc4 12.Bxc4 c5 challenging White's center). One alternative approach was introduced in a game Kramnik–Topalov (2014 candidates), where the game continued 8.Bd3 Bg7 9.0-0 0-0 10.Ne5. This could be a strong square for the knight, since Black cannot really challenge it with a move ...f7–f6, given the weaknesses of the kingside pawns. The game continued 10...c5 11.cxd5 cxd4 12.exd4 exd5 13.Re1 Be6 14.Bb5, restricting the black knight and securing a good position for White.
Instead of the more calm and positional 6.Bxf6, White has the option of retreating the bishop with 6.Bh4. This allows Black to capture and keep the c4-pawn, but in return offers White a lot of active play against Black's weakened pawn structure and vulnerable king. The game typically continues 6...dxc4 7.e4 (note: 7.a4 to prevent Black's b5 does not work, see below) g5 8.Bg3 b5 and Black has been able to defend the pawn on c4, but his position is full of weaknesses for White to attack. The Anti-Moscow Variation leads to a very complicated game, similar to the Botvinnink Variation in many ways.
Note: In such positions, White often considers pushing a2–a4 to prevent Black from defending the c4-pawn with b5. In this particular case, 7.a4 is a mistake. First, Black can play 7...b5 anyway, with the idea that 8.axb5 cxb5 9.Nxb5 Qb6 10.Na3 Qxb2 is very good for Black. (There are some other variations, including taking Bxf6 at some point, but Black is better in any case.) Second, Black can play 7...Bb4, followed up by b5, and Black is a pawn up and it is difficult to believe White has enough compensation.
White has a number of typical plans to attack the Black position all over the board. On the kingside, White can consider the move h2–h4, possibly further weakening Black's kingside pawn structure. In the center, White often plays Ne5 and opens up the d1–h5 diagonal for his queen and bishop, as well as looks for opportunities to break through with d4–d5. It is worth mentioning that pushing the e-pawn to e5 is often not a good idea, since it blocks the white minor pieces. On the queenside, White often plays moves like a2–a4 and b2–b3 to undermine the Black pawn structure. All of this is combined with the fact that the Black king has no strong shelter to hide, so a constant threat of mating attacks hangs in the air.
White typically continues 9.Be2, and Black responds with 9...Bb7. This is an important prophylactic move by Black, as White is constantly threatening to push d4–d5 to break through in the center. White now has the option of playing either 10.h4 or 10.0-0. A typical line after the former is 10.h4 g4 11.Ne5 h5 12.0-0 Nbd7, 13.Qc2 Nxe5 14.Bxe5 Bg7 with various possible continuations and possibly still a slight advantage for White. The latter often leads to wild complications after 10.0-0 Nbd7 11.Ne5 Bg7, and now White can choose between two very different continuations. The first one is 12.Nxd7, which typically continues 12...Nxd7 13.Bd6 a6 14.a4 e5 and so on. The second one, first seen in 2008 in a game between Topalov and Kramnik, is the flashy 12.Nxf7 (a full piece sacrifice), which leads to a wild attack after 12...Kxf7 13.e5 Nd5 14.Ne4 Ke7 15.Nd6 Qb6 16.Bg4 and White has a great position, strong knight on d6, control over the center and the light squares, and pressure against the weak e6 pawn. Although Black might be objectively able to survive and even convert hismaterial advantageto a win, the complications are huge, and whoever is better prepared to deal with the position certainly has the upper hand in practical games.
The Botvinnik Variation is probably one of the most complicated of all chess openings, with theory stretching past move thirty in some variations. The opening was introduced byMikhail Botvinnikin the 1945 USSR vs. USA radio match vs.Arnold Denker. Today,Alex Yermolinskyhas an excellent record with the white pieces andAlexei Shirovhas been Black's chief proponent in this variation. Although this variation bears Botvinnik's name, he was not the first person known to have played it—Klaus Jungeis credited as the actual inventor.[8]Black makes the thematic pawn capture 5...dxc4 immediately. White takes control of the center with 6.e4 as Black defends his extra pawn with 6...b5. The main line of the Botvinnik now continues 7.e5 h6 8.Bh4 g5 9.Nxg5 hxg5 (9...Nd5 is sometimes played, and after 10.Nxf7 Qxh4 11.Nxh8 Bb4 12.Rc1 White is objectively much better, but the position is incredibly complex to play in practice for both sides) 10.Bxg5 Nbd7 (diagram) (10...Be7 11.exf6 Bxf6 12.Bxf6 Qxf6 13.g3 should be favorable for White). White will regain his piece with interest, emerging with an extra pawn, but Black will soon complete his development, gaining great dynamic compensation, whereas White's task is rather more difficult. White will fianchetto his king bishop and castle kingside, while Black will play ...c5, ...Qb6, castle queenside, and can carry out an attack in the center or on either flank, leading to complex play.
The main continuation is 11.g3, aiming to quickly take control of the long diagonal. White can also play 11.exf6, but after 11...Bb7 12.g3 c5 13.d5 White has given Black some additional options compared to the main move, such as ...Nb6, ...Ne5, ...Qc7 or ...Bh6, which was not necessary. The 11.g3 move order does, however, open up the possibility of 11...Rg8, and play might continue 12.h4 Rxg5 13.hxg5 Nd5 14.g6 fxg6 15.Qg4 Qe7 16.Bg2 with a slight advantage for White. The main continuation is 11...Bb7 12.Bg2 Qb6 13.exf6 0-0-0 14.0-0 c5 (14...Ne5 is also an option: White can simply capture 15.dxe5, and while Black wins the queen after 15...Rxd1 16.Raxd1, white seems to have the upper hand at least according to engines. In practical play, this variation is no different to most Botvinnik variations – a slight sidestep may lead to immediate disaster for either player) 15.d5 b4 (diagram) and we have reached one of the key positions of the Botvinnik Variation. White now has two main continuations: 16.Na4 and 16.Rb1.
The most challenging continuation is 16.Na4, where Black has two main replies. The first one, although not the best one, is 16...Qa6, leading to another wild and forcing continuation: 17.a3 Bxd5 18.Bxd5 Ne5 19.axb4 Rxd5 20.Qe2 cxb4 21.Nc3. The second one and probably the better one, is 16...Qb5, after which play might continue with multiple forcing moves 17.a3 Nb8 18.axb4 cxb4 19.Qg4 Bxd5 20.Rfc1 Nc6 21.Bxd5 Rxd5 22.Rxc4 Rxg5 23.Qd4 Kb8 24.Rxc6 Rxg3+ 25.fxg3 Qxc6 26.Rd1 Qc7 and so on.
With this somewhat odd-looking move White actually prevents Black from capturing the c3-knight (16...bxc3 17.bxc3 Qa6 18.Rxb7 followed up by 19.dxe6 would be completely winning for White). Black would respond 16...Qa6 and play typically continues in a completely bizarre Botvinnik fashion: 17.dxe6 Bxg2 18.e7 Bxf1 and now either 19.Kxf1 or 19.Qd5 and so on. These positions are highly dynamic and favor first and foremost the better-prepared player, although objectively speaking White might have a slight advantage.
Black breaks thepinon the h4–d8 diagonal and forms a pin of his own on the c3-knight (exploiting the absence of the White's queen bishop from thequeenside). If Black later plays dxc4, there may be threats against the g5-bishop.
Breaking the pin with 5...Be7 transposes to the lines of Orthodox Defense of the Queen's Gambit Declined. This move is, however, less challenging for White, at least judging by the fact that White scores more than 70% in top-level games. An example continuation is 6.e3 Nbd7 7.Qc2 0-0 8.Rd1 and White has a comfortable position.
Although more than 90% of games continue with either 5.Bg5 or 5.e3, there are some sidelines that are worth a quick look.
The move 5.Qb3 is an alternative way of protecting the c-pawn. If Black continues with the typical 5...Nbd7, White can play 6.Bg5 and this is supposed to lead to a favorable version of a Queen's Gambit Declined. If Black plays 5...dxc4 instead, White will recapture with 6.Qxc4 (see below).
The move 5.Qd3 is often combined with the idea of pushing e2–e4 in the near future. If Black continues in a typical Semi-Slav fashion with 5...Nbd7, then White can immediately play 6.e4, and after 6...dxe4 7.Nxe4 Nxe4 8.Qxe4 Bb4+ 9.Bd2 Bxd2+ 10.Nxd2 the game is pretty much even. White also has the option of playing 6.g3, leading to some sort of Catalan setup. If Black plays 5...dxc4 instead, White will recapture with 6.Qxc4 (see below).
After either queen move, Black can continue in Semi-Slav style by capturing the white pawn with 5...dxc4. Play will continue 6.Qxc4 b5, and now White can retreat his queen back to either b3 or d3. After 7.Qb3, the game might continue 7...Nbd7 8.Bg5 Be7 9.e3 with equal opportunities. The move 7.Qd3 is an alternative, and Black's best reply is considered to be 7...a6 8.e4 c5 and Black is supposed to be fine after either 9.dxc5 or 9.e5.
By playing 5.g3, White makes a claim that he's ready to play the Catalan, with the black pawn a bit passively on c6. This practically forces Black to take the c-pawn with 5...dxc4. White will continue 6.Bg2 (6.a4 c5 is supposed to be good for Black), and Black has now two main choices. First, he can play 6...b5, and the game might continue in Catalan style with 7.Ne5 a6 8.a4 (8.Nxc6 Qb6 is fine for Black) Bb7 and so on. Second, he can play 6...Nbd7 preventing white's Ne5, which might lead to 7.0-0 Be7 8.e4 0-0.
Developing the bishop to f4 might seem reasonable at first, but in this particular opening it is not the correct approach by White. After 5.Bf4 Black responds thematically 5...dxc4 (anything else is good for White), and is ready to defend the c-pawn with the standard push b7–b5. White's best attempt might be to continue 6.a4, but Black now has the move 6...Nd5 (since the knight is not pinned by the White bishop as it would be in the standard Bg5 lines). White's best continuation is probably 7.Bg5, underlining the fact that this is where the bishop should have gone in the first place. After 7...Be7 8.Bxe7 Qxe7 Black is probably slightly better. If White plays 6.e4 as he would in a Botvinnik variation with the bishop on g5, Black simply responds 6...b5 and this must be a much better version of the Botvinnik for Black since White lacks the usual counterplay with e4–e5 against the pinned knight. Finally, the same logic applies for 6.e3 b5, and White cannot claim having enough dynamic compensation for the pawn.

## Sicilian Defense
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Sicilian-Defense)
The Sicilian Defense is the most popular response to White's 1.e4. Employed by masters and beginners alike, the Sicilian Defense is a reputable and positionally sound opening. Still, the Sicilian is a combative opening that tends to lead to dynamic and sharp positions.
One of the oldest registered openings, the Sicilian is full of theory and was used by most of the greatest players in history. World champions GMsBobby Fischer,Garry Kasparov,Viswanathan Anand,Vladimir Kramnik, andMagnus Carlsenare just a few of its adopters.
TheSicilian Defensestarts after the moves1.e4 c5, when Black chooses to imbalance the position from the start. Black's reason behind 1...c5 is to fight for their share of the center (specifically, the d4-square) with a wing pawn.
Black intends to advance the d and e-pawns later to control critical squares. Frequently, White will put pressure on one side of the board while Black will fight for their dominance over the other side. This dynamic usually creates tactically rich games with more decisive results.
Being one of the oldest and most respected openings for Black, the Sicilian has an extensive amount of theory. There are numerous variations, each of them dissected thoroughly. Below you can see a list with a few of the main lines of the Sicilian Defense.
When faced with the Sicilian, White has the option of either opening or closing the position. The Closed Variation is not the most common but is also widely popular and was one of GMBoris Spassky's weapons of choice with White. It starts after the moves1.e4 c5 2.Nc3, when White signals they have no intention of immediately opening up the center. White will usually expand on the kingside in the main lines of this variation.
The Open Variation is the most common way for White to meet the Sicilian. It starts after the moves1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4or1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4. As the name suggests, this variation leads to more open and tactical games. White will gain space and immediately fight over control of the center, while Black will enjoy a semi-open c-file and active piece play.

The Najdorf Variation is one of the most popular lines in the Sicilian Defense and was frequently used by both Fischer and Kasparov. It starts after the moves1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6. Black's 5...a6 prepares counterplay on the queenside while maintaining flexibility. Heavily theoretical, this line usually leads to complex games with a wealth of tactical possibilities.
The Alapin Variation happens after the moves1.e4 c5 2.c3. White's 2.c3 prepares the d2-d4 pawn advance, with the downside that the c3-square will no longer be available for the knight. This line is excellent for players who want to avoid the massive amount of theory behind other variations.
The Dragon Variation occurs after1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 g6. Black fianchettoes their dark-squared bishop, attacking the center and the queenside. This variation is one of the most aggressive for Black. In its most critical lines, Black castles kingside and White castles queenside, with both players racing to checkmate first.
The French Variation of the Sicilian Defense starts after the moves1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6. Black opts for a more flexible setup, usually avoiding the more tactical lines of the Sicilian. After this, several other well-known variations like the Taimanov, Scheveningen, Four Knights, and Paulsen can arise.
The Sicilian Defense is one of the oldest known openings in chess. The Italian player Polerio mentioned the opening in 1594, which was also analyzed later by other Italian players. The match betweenLouis-Charles de La BourdonnaisandAlexander McDonnellfor the unofficial title of World Champion helped popularize the opening in 1834.
The opening started surging in popularity by the second half of the 20th century, with players like GMsAlexander Kotov,Bent Larsen,Mark Taimanov, andMikhail Taladopting the opening. Later, former world champions Fischer and Kasparov cemented the opening's reputation as one of the best fighting options against 1.e4.

## Slav Defense
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Slav-Defense)
The Slav Defense is a solid opening for Black in response to White's Queen's Gambit (1.d4 d5 2.c4). Black fights for equality against one of White's most popular openings without creating a bad light-squared bishop—one of the downsides of other defenses like the French Defense and the Queen's Gambit Declined.
An extremely popular opening which has been endorsed by many world champions such as GMsMax Euwe,Mikhail Botvinnik,Vladimir Kramnik,Viswanathan Anand, andMagnus Carlsen. Usually leading to slower games, the Slav is a good choice for players at any level.
TheSlav Defensestarts after the moves1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6. Black avoids taking White's c4-pawn to keep their firm grasp of the center, particularly the e4-square. The characteristic2...c6supports the d5-pawn while not locking the light-squared bishop inside the pawn chain as it happens in other openings such as the French Defense and Queen's Gambit Declined.
Of course, there's a downside to the move 2...c6. The c7-c6 pawn push doesn't help develop any pieces, and the pawn blocks the knight's most natural development square.
As with most of the other major openings among grandmasters, the Slav has an extensive theory. The three variations listed below are by far the most popular:
The main line of the Slav Defense results in a balanced position. Both sides have a multitude of options as to how to conduct the game.
1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 dxc4 5.a4 Bf5 6.e3 e6 7.Bxc4
By playing the Quiet Variation of the Modern Line, White can avoid learning heavy theory. White gets a good position out of the opening by relying on simple development and a solid pawn structure.
1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.e3
Despite being a variation of the Slav, the Semi-Slav branches out from standard Slav theory and can be considered a different opening. The Semi-Slav is the second most popular option for Black and it often leads to closed positions.
1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 e6
The Chameleon Variation is the second most popular choice for Black after 4...dxc4. This system is very flexible, as multiple pawn structures may arise from this variation. Black plays 4...a6 to support the b5-square.
1.d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 a6
The Exchange Variation is the most uneventful line of the Slav Defense despite its immense popularity. Of the more than 4,600 games with this line in our database, 65% of them ended in a draw. The positions in this variation are very symmetrical, with little chance for either of the players to create serious threats. The most popular continuation of this line sees both players exchanging their pieces and reaching a drawn position.
Even though the results aren't compelling, the Exchange Variation is the simplest way of playing against the Slav and retains the initiative of having the first move as White.
1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.cxd5
White usually scores well against the Slav Defense, which is good news for the Queen's Gambit player. The move 2...c6 is the most popular response to 2.c4, despite White winning 40% of games, drawing 39%, and losing only 21%.
Below you can learn two of the best scoring variations against the main line and the Chameleon, by far the two variations that Black chooses most often.
The Bled Attack is a great way to fight against the main line of the Slav. White plays 6.Nh4 to threaten Black's light-squared bishop, and Black can already go wrong in a few different ways in this position. White wins 48% of the time, draws 32%, and loses 20% when employing this variation.
This line is particularly interesting since the Slav player usually wants to put their light-squared bishop to good use, and the Bled Attack makes this harder to achieve.
1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 dxc4 5.a4 Bf5 6.Nh4
The Quiet Variation of the Modern Line is probably the most straightforward way of playing against the Slav. White plays 4.e3 to build strong central control and develops naturally to get a good position. Particularly interesting is the line where White develops the light-squared bishop to d3 and the b1-knight to d2. White wins 49% of the games, draws 37%, and loses a mere 13% of the games in this line.
1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.e3 e6 5.Bd3 Nbd7 6.Nbd2
Against the Chameleon variation, engines and masters endorse the move 5.c5. White punishes Black for weakening the b6-square (after pushing both the a and c-pawns). Black can fight back, but the positions that arise in this line are usually easier for White to play, with more space and straightforward plans. White wins 41% of the games in this variation, draws 34%, and loses only 24%.
1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 a6 5.c5
The Slav Defense is a relatively new opening, despite being a tremendously popular response to the common Queen's Gambit. Chess master Semyon Alapin started developing the theory for the opening—leading to the Alapin Variation, the main line of the Slav.
The opening gained traction after Euwe andAlexander Alekhineused it extensively in their two world championship matches. Since then, many of the world's strongest players have adopted the opening, such as GMs Anand, Kramnik, and Carlsen.
Many players opted for the Slav during their careers. If you want to learn more about this opening, you can study the games of Euwe, Alekhine, Anand, and Kramnik. Below you can see two famous games with the Slav Defense:
Euwe vs. Alekhine, 1937
GM Veselin Topalov vs. Kramnik, 2006
You now know what the Slav Defense is, how to play it, how to play against it, its history, and more. Head over to ourMaster Gamespage to analyze top players' games in the Slav to learn even more about it!

TheSlav Defenseis achess openingthat begins with the moves:
The Slav is one of the primary defenses to theQueen's Gambit. Although it was analyzed as early as 1590, it was not until the 1920s that it started to be explored extensively, although Steinitz essayed it in the first officialWorld Chess Championship of 1886. Many masters ofSlavicdescent helped develop thetheoryof this opening, includingAlapin,Alekhine,Bogoljubov, andVidmar.
The Slav received an exhaustive test during the two Alekhine–EuweWorld Championshipmatches in 1935 and 1937. Played by 11 of the first 13 world champions, this defense was particularly favored byEuwe,Botvinnik, andSmyslov. More recently the Slav has been adopted byAnand,Ivanchuk,Lautier,Short, and other topgrandmasters, including use in six of the eight games thatVladimir Kramnikplayed as Black in the2006 World Championship(in the other two, he played the relatedSemi-Slav Defense).
Today the theory of the Slav is very extensive and well-developed.
There are three main variations of the Slav:
Black faces two major problems in many variations of theQueen's Gambit Declined(QGD):
The "Pure" Slav and a6 Slav address these problems. Black's queen bishop is unblocked; the pawn structure remains balanced. Also, if Black later takes the gambit pawn with ...dxc4, the support provided by the pawn on c6 (and possibly ...a6) allows ...b5 which may threaten to keep the pawn, or drive away a white piece that has captured it, gaining Black atempofor queenside expansion. On the other hand, Black usually will not be able to develop the queen bishop without first giving up the center with ...dxc4, developing the bishop may leave the black queenside weak, and the thematic break ...c5 incurs the loss of atempo.
The Slav can be entered by many move orders. The possibilities include 1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.c4 c6, 1.Nf3 d5 2.c4 c6 3.d4 Nf6, and so on.
The main line is 3.Nf3. White can also try the following alternatives:
Black often plays 3...Nf6 but 3...Bf5 is considered to be an easier equalizer. Also, 3...Nf6 4.Nc3 (same as 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e3 below) may give Black some move-order issues for those wanting to play the "Pure" Slav and not the Semi-Slav or ...a6 Slav.
The Exchange Variation was once described as "the system that takes the fun out of playing the Slav" for Black.[1]After 3.cxd5 cxd5, the symmetrical position offers White only the advantage of the extra move, but thedrawishposition offers Black little chance to win unless White is overly ambitious. The rooks will often be exchanged down the now open c-file. This line is often used as a drawing weapon and if both players want to draw, they can play the symmetrical line, which continues 3...cxd5 4.Nf3 Nf6 5.Nc3 Nc6 6.Bf4 Bf5, resulting in a totally symmetrical position where every piece is developed to a good square. To avoid the possibility of the Exchange Slav Black often chooses the move order 2...e6 followed by 3...c6 to enter the Semi-Slav, this is known as the Triangle System.
The pressure on Black's center prevents 3...Bf5? since after 4.cxd5 cxd5 5.Qb3 White wins a pawn. Black can try the Winawer Countergambit, 3...e5, which was introduced inMarshall–Winawer,Monte Carlo1901 but this is thought to be slightly better for White. The most common continuation is 3...Nf6 when 4.Nf3 transposes to the main line. White can also play 4.e3 when it was thought Black could no longer play the "Pure" Slav with 4...Bf5 (and had to choose between 4...e6 or 4...a6) due to 5.cxd5 cxd5 6.Qb3. Therefore, "Pure" Slav players sometimes meet 3.Nc3 with 3...dxc4, the Argentinian Defense, which can transpose to the main line of the "Pure" Slav. Recently the Gambit 4...Bf5 5.cxd5 cxd5 6.Qb3 Nc6 7.Qxb7 Bd7 has revitalized 4...Bf5.
Black usually plays 3...Nf6. 3...e6 may lead to various possibilities, such as theNoteboom Variation,Semi-Slav DefenseorStonewall Dutch. 3...Bf5? is a mistake due to 4.cxd5 cxd5 5.Qb3, where black must play 5...Bc8 to avoid losing the b-pawn. Attempts such as 5...b6? fail due to e.g 6.Bg5 e6 7.e4! dxe4 8.Bb5+ Nbd7 9. Ne5 with 10.Bxf6 to follow.[citation needed]
After 3...Nf6, the main line is 4.Nc3. White can also try the following alternatives:
A line that is similar to theCatalan Openingis 4.Qc2 or 4.Qb3. Often, White will fianchetto his light-square bishop. This has the disadvantage of White's queen being somewhat exposed on c2. Black can meet 4.Qc2 with 4...g6, intending 5...Bf5. White usually plays 5.Bf4 so that after 5...Bf5 6.Qb3 Qb6 White can play 7.c5! Black has to play 7...Qxb3, which will be met by 8.axb3. White has a moderate advantage in this queenless middlegame, as White can expand on the queenside and try to create play on the queenside, but Black's position is solid. The most common continuations are 4...dxc4 5.Qxc4 Bf5 or 5...Bg4.
Another Catalan style approach is 4.g3.
White can avoid the complexities of the main line 4.Nc3 by playing 4.e3. The most common continuation is 4...Bf5 5.Nc3 e6 6.Nh4, when White wins the bishop pair but Black gets a solid position and often gets counterplay with ...e5. This line was tested several times in the2006 World Chess Championship. Alternatively, 5.cxd5 cxd5 6.Qb3 Qc7 is fine for Black.  White will try to take advantage of the absence of Black's queen bishop on the queenside, but this isn't enough to gain an advantage if Black plays accurately. Another way to play is 4...Bg4.
While 4...Bf5 is playable, it is not the best choice for Black, because White will gain the advantage with either 5.Qb3 or 5.cxd5 followed by 6.Qb3. Traditionally Black had a choice between 4...e6, the Semi-Slav, and 4...dxc4 before developing the queen bishop, but in the 1990s 4...a6 was introduced, with the idea of developing the queenside without locking in the queen bishop or conceding the center.
The a6 Slav occurs after 4...a6. Black seeks an early b5, either before or after capturing at c4.
White can achieve an important space advantage with 5.c5.  Both e5 and b6 become important pawn breaks for Black.  White will often play his bishop to f4, controlling the important dark squares e5, d6, c7, and b8 (this last square reduces Black's control over the b-file should it open).  The game can continue 5...Bf5 6.Bf4 Nbd7 7.e3 Nh5!.[2]
After 4...dxc4, the main line is 5.a4. White can also try the following alternatives
White's sharpest try against 4...dxc4 is the Slav Geller Gambit, 5.e4. Play usually continues 5...b5 6.e5 Nd5 7.a4 e6, but it is unclear whether the attack is strong enough for the sacrificed pawn. Evaluation of this line changes as improvements are found, but as of 2005 it is generally thought to favor Black.
5.e3 is a solid choice known as the Alekhine Variation. Play can proceed 5...b5 6.a4 b4
With 5.a4, White acts against ...b5 and prepares 6.e4 and 7.Bxc4. Black's main move is 5...Bf5. Black can also try the following alternatives:
In the Steiner Variation (also called theBronsteinVariation), 5...Bg4, White may be discouraged from e4 by the possibility 6.e4 e5. More often the game continues 6.Ne5 Bh5.
With the Smyslov Variation, 5...Na6, Black allows the e-pawn to come to e4 but can gain counterplay by ...Bg4 and perhaps bringing the knight to b4 e.g. 6.e4 Bg4 7.Bxc4 e6 8.0-0 Nb4.
The Czech Variation can be considered the main line. With 5...Bf5, Black prevents 6.e4.
If White plays 6.e3, the Dutch Variation, play can continue 6...e6 7.Bxc4 Bb4 8.0-0 0-0 with a fairly quiet game. Black can also play 6...Na6 with the idea of 7...Nb4, known as the Dutch, Lasker Variation.
A more energetic line begins 6.Ne5 (Krause Attack) where White intends f2–f3 and e2–e4 or Nxc4, perhaps followed by afianchettoof the king bishop with g2–g3 and Bg2. Black can try either 6...Nbd7 7.Nxc4 Qc7 8.g3 e5 (known as the Carlsbad Variation) or 7...Nb6 or 6...e6 7.f3 Bb4, when 8.e4 Bxe4 9.fxe4 Nxe4 is a complex piece sacrifice with the semi-forced continuation 10.Bd2 Qxd4 11.Nxe4 Qxe4+ 12.Qe2 Bxd2+ 13.Kxd2 Qd5+ 14.Kc2 Na6. White can also play 10.Qf3 and force a draw.

## Smith Morra Gambit
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Sicilian-Defense-Smith-Morra-Gambit)
TheSmith-Morra Gambit(also known as the Morra Gambit) is one of the ways for White to respond to theSicilian Defense. This gambit line can lead to open, sharp games that are very dangerous for the unprepared player. Although the Smith-Morra is less common among grandmasters, it can still be an effective weapon for club-level players.
The Smith-Morra Gambit is one of White's responses to the Sicilian Defense. It starts after the moves1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3.
White attacks Black's d4-pawn, offering agambit. If Black accepts the sacrifice, White's position opens up, making it easier for them to develop their pieces to active squares, from where they'll attack mainly the weak f7-square and the center. Accepting the gambit also gives White an extratempo(after they recapture with 4.Nxc3) and better control of the center, thanks to the d4-pawn. Finally, the pawn sacrifice allows White to quickly gain control of the open c-file, which is usually one of the sources of counterplay for Black in the Sicilian Defense.
When entering the Smith-Morra Gambit, Black can accept or decline the pawn sacrifice. Below you can learn more about the main variations Black can use to face this opening.
Accepting the gambit is Black's most critical way of playing, and among masters, it usually yields better results for the prepared Black player. The main line when accepting the gambit is the Scheveningen Formation, which occurs after the moves1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 Nc6 5.Nf3 d6 6.Bc4 e6.
Black is a pawn up, but White has a clear development lead, with three developed pieces against Black's lonely knight. Black maintains a compact and flexible pawn structure in the center and will usually try to castle as fast as possible. White will try to bring their pieces to active squares, delay Black's castling, and use their piece activity to start a devastating attack.
Another popular way of accepting the gambit is with the Paulsen Formation, which happens with the moves1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 Nc6 5.Nf3 e6 6.Bc4 a6.
Black plays 6...a6 to prevent White from playing the annoying 7.Nb5, when White would be better. From there, Black usually either expands on the queenside with a quick 7...b5 or develops the kingside knight with 7...Nge7. In many cases, Black delays castling or maintains their king in the center for the rest of the game.
If Black wants to avoid a tactical game, they can decline the gambit with the Push Variation, which starts with1. e4 c5 2. d4 cxd4 3. c3 d3.
The idea behind pushing the d-pawn is to avoid taking on c3 (allowing White to gain a tempo by recapturing with the knight). This move also prevents White from playing 4.cxd4, which would give them a strong center. White can either capture Black's d3-pawn with the bishop or push their pawn to c4, going for aMaroczy Bindpawn structure.
Another way for Black to decline the gambit is to transpose into theAlapin Sicilian. The first way to achieve this is by transposing into the main line with1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 Nf6.
Black's other option is to go for a line resembling the Barmen Defense of the Alapin Sicilian, where Black develops their dark-squared bishop with a fianchetto. This line starts with the moves1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 g6.
The Smith-Morra Gambit is named after Pierre Morra and Ken Smith, who helped popularize the opening. Morra was the first to publish a booklet and a few articles analyzing the opening around 1950. Smith later published, over 30 years, nine books and 49 articles on the gambit.
Nowadays, one of the opening's biggest proponents is IM Marc Esserman. He wrote a book on the subject calledMayhem In The Morraand won a famous game using the opening against the super GMLoek van Wely.

# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Morra_Gambit)
Inchess, theSmith–Morra Gambit(or simplyMorra Gambit) is anopeninggambitagainst theSicilian Defencedistinguished by the moves:
White sacrifices apawntodevelopquickly and create attacking chances. In exchange for the gambit pawn, White has a piece developed after 4.Nxc3 and a pawn in thecenter, while Black has an extra pawn and a central pawn majority. The plan for White is straightforward and consists of placing hisbishopon c4 to attack the f7-square, and controlling both the c- and d-fileswithrooks, taking advantage of the fact that Black can hardly find a suitable place to post hisqueen.
The Smith–Morra is uncommon ingrandmastergames, but is popular at club level.[4]It does not have a definitive refutation.
The Smith–Morra is named afterPierre Morra[fr](1900–1969) from France,[5]andKen Smith(1930–1999) of theDallas Chess Club.[6]In Europe the nameMorra Gambitis preferred; other names for it, includingTartakower GambitandMatulovic Gambit, have disappeared.
Around 1950, Morra published a booklet and several articles about the Smith–Morra. Smith wrote a total of nine books and forty-nine articles about the gambit. When Smith participated in an international tournament against several top grandmasters inSan Antonioin 1972, he essayed the opening three times, againstDonald Byrne,Larry Evans, andHenrique Mecking, but lost all three games.
Many players consider the opening amateurish[citation needed]. International MasterMarc Essermanis one of its leading advocates today. Recently in April 2023,Hikaru NakamuradefeatedFabiano Caruanawith it to win the Chessable Masters.[7]
Black has a wide choice of reasonable defences after 1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3. White sometimes plays 2.Nf3 and 3.c3, which depending on Black's response may rule out certain lines.  3.Qxd4 Nc6 4.Qe3 is the Sicilian Center Game, similar to theCenter Game, 1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.Qxd4 Nc6 4.Qe3.
In return for the sacrificed pawn, White acquires a number of benefits that can be used to create active plans:
The mix of short- and long-term ideas means that the character of positions arising from this gambit can be described as a mix of theStafford Gambitand theBenko Gambit: to survive against a well-prepared White player, Black must first navigate the minefield of traps in the opening, then contend with White's long-term pressure and initiative. If Black manages to do this while holding on to the extra pawn, he/she will have good chances to win the ensuing endgame. This is not easy, however, and many Sicilian players opt to decline the gambit altogether.
This line is similar to theDanish Gambit: 4...cxb2 5.Bxb2
The latter has a bad reputation, as square c3 is free for the knight. Still 5...Nf6 (5...e5; 5...Nc6 6.Nf3 e5) 6.Nf3 e6 7.Nc3 Qd6 is likely to transpose to a main line of the Alapin: 2.c3 d5 3.exd5 Qxd5 4.d4 e6 5.Nf3 Nf6 6.Bd3 Nc6 7.0-0 cxd4 8.cxd4 Be7 9.Nc3 Qd6.

## Stafford Gambit
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/blog/ThummimS/stafford-gambit-traps-a-complete-guide)
1. Introduction
The Stafford Gambit is an objectively dubious, but highly venomous opening. A variationof Petrov's Defense, Black sacrifices a pawn on the third move for a quick attack. But is it a sound gambit? Should White accept the gambit to gain an advantage? Or should they decline it?
The Stafford Gambit certainly isn't an objectively good opening.
However, it's a tricky opening, and can be a weapon for Black in blitz and bullet games if White is not familiar with the gambit. Although it can give yousome fun wins, it's not an opening that you should consider playing in classical games though, especiallynot in longer time controls when your opponents have more time to think things through.


From this position, there are so many traps unsuspecting players can stumble into from the white side.
Black sacrifices a pawn and gives up all center pawns. In return, black hopes to get initiative and an attack on the kingside.
Black will often play Bc5, followed up by Ng4 to put pressure on the f2 pawn. Later, the move Qh4 with even more pressure on the f2 and h2 pawns is a common idea.
White will try to consolidate. Often played ideas for white are c3, followed by d4, to cut the bishop on c5 off from the diagonal.
White will often delay casting in order to defend against blacks immediate attacking ideas first.
2. Oh no my queen!

3. Oh no my knight!

4. Take my knight, but I'll take your rook!

6. Punishing natural development


8. Drag white's king to e4 (before move 10)


9. Everyone falls for this trap


10. Miscellaneous Lines


11. Refutation
With the high amount of traps that black could play, it's easy to fall into one if you are unprepared and under time pressure as the white player.
How can white refute the Stafford Gambit?
It should come to no surprise that the Stafford Gambit isn't a rock-solid opening — white can refute it and get away with an advantage.
The first move that you have to play in order to refute the Stafford is 5. d3, to protect the e4 pawn. After 5. … Bc5, you should play 6. Be2 to defend against Ng4.


Now the most testing move for black is 6. … h5.
A side variation is 6. … Ng4, with the idea of ​​playing Qh4 to fork the bishop on g4 and the f2 pawn.


But after 7. Bxg4 Qh4 8. g3 Qxg4 9. Qxg4 Bxg4 white is a comfortable pawn up.


It may appear that black has compensation because of the bishop pair and a development advantage, but the strong center pawns actually mean that black has nothing for the pawn.
Let's get back to the main move 6. … h5. The idea is clear — black wants to play Ng4.


Here, white has to play the key move 7. c3!


This strong move stops all of black's ideas. Ng4 is no longer dangerous because of d4. Black has to be prophylactic here and play 7. … Bb6.


This stops d4 because the pawn on e4 hangs otherwise. Now 8. Nd2 protects the e4 pawn and prepares d4.


A possible continuation could be 8. … Ng4 9. d4 c5 10. h3.


This position is pretty bad for black, he's a pawn down and white dominates positionally because he controls the center. Black will still try to play for tricks and I suggest that you analyze these lines for yourself as well.

**********

To conclude, though it may not be possible to cover every single line in the Stafford Gambit, through this comprehensive guide hopefully now you should have a better idea of ​​​​what Black must achieve and what White must avoid in this highly venomous opening.

# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Petrovs-Defense-Classical-Stafford-Gambit)
The Stafford Gambit is a dangerous but objectively dubious variation ofPetrov's Defensein which Black sacrifices a pawn for a quick attack. Although not good in longer time controls when your opponents have more time to think things through, it is a tricky opening and can be a weapon for Black inblitzandbulletgames if White is not familiar with the gambit.
The Stafford Gambit goes1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nxe5and, instead of the usual 3...d6,3...Nc6. The main point is after4.Nxc6 dxc6(but not 4...bxc6?) Black can develop very quickly and aggressively.
White can actually avoid the gambit altogether with3.Bc4or3.Nc3, or decline it with4.Nf3or4.d4on the next move. Although not objectively best, these are safe choices for a player who has rarely or never faced the Stafford before.
Because the Stafford is so rare at high levels, not much traditional theory has developed around the gambit. Thus, instead of variations, there are some common traps Black can set against an unsuspecting opponent, and how White can avoid them.
One of the most common dead-lost lines for White was also the one played when the Stafford was introduced in 1950 (reasonably enough by a player, whose first name was not recorded, with the surname Stafford):
Black can also use the Stafford to trap White into an early forced checkmate—White is objectively lost in the previous line, but can try to play on in blitz or bullet. This one is important to know and somewhat reminiscent ofLegal's Mate, but with Black winning:
The main danger of facing the Stafford is that White can't just get away with natural moves. Notably, White shouldnotbe in a rush to castle kingside, as that is often a blunder that falls right into Black's attack, even before Black is fully developed.
The line that best demonstrates these truths is this one:
Despite all of Black's tricks, White can in fact keep the pawn and stay out of trouble in the opening.
Perhaps the easiest and safest way is the following:
It's not possible to cover every single line in the Stafford, but you should hopefully now have a better idea of what Black wants to achieve and what White wants to avoid in this opening.
The Stafford Gambit is named for the correspondence player who won a game in six moves in 1950 with the opening, using one of the above traps. In modern times, the gambit was popularized by streamer IMEric Rosen. In this video with Rosen playing on Chess.com, he demonstrates many more points of the Stafford:

## Staunton Gambit Accepted
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Dutch-Defense-Staunton-Gambit-Accepted)

---

# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staunton_Gambit)
TheStaunton Gambitis achess openingcharacterised by the moves:
White sacrifices a pawn for quickdevelopment, with the idea of launching an attack against Black'skingside, which has been somewhat weakened by 1...f5. Black can decline the gambit with 2...d6,transposingto theBalogh Defence, but accepting the pawn with 2...fxe4 is considered stronger.
Although the Staunton Gambit was once a feared weapon for White, it is rarely played today, since theory has shown how to neutralise it, and White scores only about 50 percent.
TheECOcodes for Staunton Gambit are A82 and A83.
After 2...fxe4, play usually proceeds 3.Nc3 Nf6.
The main line runs 4.Bg5, first played byHoward StauntonagainstBernhard Horwitzin London, 1846.[1]
After 4.Bg5, a common trap is 4...d5?5.Bxf6 exf6 6.Qh5+ g6 7.Qxd5 Qxd5 8.Nxd5 when White has regained his pawn, and since his knight is attacking the pawns on both c7 and f6, will come out a pawn ahead. Instead, Black usually tries to develop quickly and fortify his kingside, giving back the pawn if necessary, with 4...Nc6 5.d5 (White can regain the pawn with 5.Bxf6 exf6 6.Nxe4, but after 6...Qe7, White has no good way to defend the knight. Everything except for 7.Qe2 allows ...d5 or ...f5, winning a piece, while after the forcing 7.Qe2 Nxd4 8.Qd3 d5 9.Qxd4 Qxe4+ 10.Qxe4 dxe4, Black has an extra pawn andthe two bishopsfor no compensation, and should win with best play.) Ne5 6.Qd4 Nf7, while 6.Qe2 is a modern alternative.
White can also try 4.f3 in the style of theBlackmar–Diemer Gambit, whereupon White gets good compensation after 4...exf3. So Black generally plays 4...d5!5.fxe4 dxe4.  Black can also try 4...e3, returning the pawn in order to hinder White's development.
4.g4?!(the Bayonet Attack or Tartakower Variation) fails to provide enoughcompensationafter 4...h6!

Not really a trap but may be useful:
There are a few traps in the Steinitz Defense.  If Black is not careful, he can run into trouble.  In this game, White traps Black's Queen.

## Stonewall Attack
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/blog/RussBell/stonewall-attack)
TheStonewall Attackis a Queen's pawn (1.d4) opening for White, which, in the hands of one who understands its relatively straightforward attacking plans and strategies, can be a lethal weapon.
While the opening is not currently in fashion, and isn't typically seen at the very highest levels, the Stonewall Attack is nevertheless very playable at the amateur and club level as most opponents at these levels will be less familiar with how to best defend against it.
The first five chapters of the book,"How to Think Ahead In Chess"by I.A. Horowitz and Fred Reinfeldare devoted to an introductory tutorial on the Stonewall Attack. The book is an "oldie but goodie" (1951), written in the older descriptive notation.  It focuses primarily on the themes, plans and strategies of the opening and is targeted to the beginner through intermediate amateur player.
The more recent"The Stonewall Attack"by Andrew Soltis(revised 2nd edition -1993, in algebraic notation) is an excellent introduction to the opening.  It was, and still is, the best introductory book on the Stonewall Attack, for every player.  I highly recommend it.  Unfortunately the book is out of print, but is available on Scribd.com as a download (under the 'Documents' menu only - search 'The Stonewall Attack Soltis')...

Stonewall Attack vs The London System
The Stonewall Attack may be viewed as a precursor toThe London Systemin the sense that the basic Kingside attacking motif of the main line Stonewall Attack can be discerned as having similarities to the main line London System (albeit in a modified form, due to the Stonewall's pawn on f4 and undeveloped dark-square Bishop).  In fact, the straight-forward attacking scheme of the Stonewall is easier to learn as there is far less opening "theory' (i.e., documented lines and variations) to deal with.  Together these two factors suggest that learning and playing the Stonewall first could be an effective avenue, or stepping stone (pun intended), for learning the London System.  In fact, particularly at the amateur level and in speed chess games (rapid, blitz, etc.), the Stonewall Attack can be played to good effect on its own, and typically much sooner compared to other, more heavily theory-laden Queen's Pawn openings.
Notable is lesson/chapter 4 of"The London System In 12 Practical Lessons"by Oscar de Prado(in my view currently the best and the most up-to-date book on the London System) which treats an alternative variation of the London System that I like to call the"London Stonewall Variation".This setup seeks to improve upon the standard Stonewall setup through White's early development and exchange of his the light-square f4-bishop prior to completing the Stonewall pawn structure (c3-d4-e3-f4).  As the author states:"The idea is that after Black's usual ...Bd6, White is going to play Bf4xd6, followed by f2-f4,setting up a version of the Stonewall, which in theory should be good for White since we've exchanged our theoretically bad bishop [Bf4] for the opponent's good one [Bd6].  [....]  This is a good alternative to have in your repertoire, varying it with the normal London System, so as to be able to surprise our opponents."
For examples of the"London Stonewall", see the following games....
Alekseev, Vadim-Sarichev, Sergey 1-0D00 RUS-Cup Minsk 2000
Moiseenko, Vadim-Truskavetsky,Alexandr 1-0 Yalos Rapid 2022
The Stonewall can also be played as Black...
Playing the Stonewall Dutch Defense as Black
Here GM Nikola Sedlak makes a convincing case for playing the Stonewall Dutch Defense in the preface to his book (below)...
https://www.qualitychess.co.uk/ebooks/PlayingtheStonewallDutch-excerpt.pdf
As afirst introductionto theStonewall Dutch Defense, I recommendMy First Chess Opening Repertoire for Blackby Vincent Moret (Chapter 9, pp. 141-177) which extensively treats this opening.  Moret provides excellent, detailed, step-by-step instruction in how to play the variation, appropriate for the novice thru intermediate player who has little-to-no prior experience with the Stonewall Dutch.
For those interested inplaying the Stonewall as Black, I also recommend the followingbooks(in the order presented, for those with no prior experience with this opening)...
Starting Out: The Dutch Defenceby Neil McDonald
Win with the Stonewall Dutchby Sverre Johnsen & Ivar Bern
Dutch Stonewallby Jacob Aagaard
Playing The Stonewall Dutchby Nikola Sedlak
The Diamond Dutchby Viktor Moskalenko
All of these books are good for their intended purpose and audience.  Neil McDonald's book is an excellent introductory overview of all of the Dutch Defense variations - Stonewall, Classical and Leningrad.  Johnsen & Bern is a comprehensive introduction to the Stonewall Dutch for all players.  Jacob Aagaard's book is a comprehensive introduction to the Stonewall Dutch, targeted primarily to experienced players.  Sedlak's book is an opening repertoire in the Stonewall Dutch Defense, targeted primarily to experienced players.  Moskalenko's book is a relatively advanced treatment of all three Dutch Defense variations, also intended for more experienced players - it includes a separate chapter on anti-Dutch systems.

# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_Attack)
TheStonewall Attackis achess openingcharacterized by White playing pawns to d4 and e3, bishop to d3, knight to d2, and then completing the Stonewall structure by playing pawns to c3 and f4. This set-up is usually achieved by a 1.d4 move order buttranspositionis also possible viaBird's Opening, 1.f4. The Stonewall Attack is asystem; White heads for a very specificpawn formation, rather than trying to memorize long lines of different variations. Black can set up in various ways in response, butMCO-15[1]gives the following as a main line: 1.d4 d5 2.e3 Nf6 3.Bd3 c5 4.c3 Nc6 5.f4.
The earliest recorded game to feature the Stonewall Attack would appear to have beenHoward StauntonvsJohn Cochrane, London, 1842. The first player to use the opening regularly, however, was theBostonmasterPreston Ware, who frequently opened 1.d4 2.f4 from 1876 to 1882. Employing this unusual move order Ware was often able to reach Stonewall type positions (although later players would usually precede f4 with moves such as e3, Bd3 and Nd2). Ware's greatest success with the opening was at the exceptionally strongVienna tournament of 1882where he defeated future world championWilhelm Steinitz.
In 1893Harry Nelson Pillsburyhad notable success with the Stonewall Attack during the two New York tournaments of that year, venturing the opening on six occasions and winning all six. After Pillsbury's success the Stonewall Attack became established in master play and appeared frequently in the games of American mastersJackson ShowalterandFrank Marshall, and English masterF.J. Lee. Other prominent players to have used the opening includedLasker,Capablanca,Alekhine,Chigorin,Rubinstein,Tarrasch,Reti,Tartakower,MaroczyandBreyer. By the early 1920s the Stonewall Attack began to disappear from top level chess, although it remains a popular choice at club level. The most notable modern day practitioner is AmericanIMYaacov Norowitz who has played the opening extensively in online blitz with considerable success.
The Stonewall set-up, when employed by Black, remains one of the main options within theDutch Defenceand has been used byMagnus Carlsento defeatViswanathan AnandandFabiano Caruana.
White's Stonewall pawn formation gives good control of the central dark squares (particularly e5, which may provide an outpost for a knight). The light squared weaknesses are covered by minor pieces (Bd3, Nd2). If permitted to do so, White may launch a direct kingside attack involving ideas such as Bxh7, Qh5 and Rf3-h3. A 1981 article in Chess Life magazine[2]gave the following line as an example of how play can develop if Black defends weakly.
While such primitive tactics cannot be expected to succeed against experienced chess players, the illustrative games below demonstrate that in the Stonewall's heyday White was often able to develop a dangerous initiative even against master level opposition.
The disadvantages of the Stonewall Attack are a rather inflexible pawn structure, long-term light square weaknesses and the 'bad bishop' on c1, constrained by White's own pawns.

## Tennison Gambit
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Reti-Opening-Tennison-Gambit)
The Tennison Gambit is an aggressive gambit opening for White. The Tennison can happen after Black goes for the Scandinavian Defense or if White plays the Reti Opening and Black plays 1...d5. Not common in master-level games, the Tennison is still a playable gambit line, especially at the club level.
White can enter the Tennison Gambit after Black plays theScandinavian Defensewith1.e4 d5 2.Nf3. White can also play the Tennison starting with theReti Openingafter1.Nf3 d5 2.e4.
White's idea is to offer a pawn for quick development and good piece activity. There are also a few traps that Black can fall into, especially if they don't know how to respond to White's threats.
The downside of the Tennison is that Black gets a superior position with correct play. However, not many players are familiar with its theory, which gives the Tennison surprise value, particularly at faster time controls.
After White enters the Tennison Gambit, Black can decline it by transposing to theFrench Defense(2...e6) or theSlav Defense(2...c6). Black can also accept the gambit with 2...dxe4. Below you can see the main variations of the accepted Tennison Gambit. Note that the variations below are listed using the Scandinavian Defense move order, but the same positions can arise from the Reti.
The main line of the Tennison Gambit starts after1.e4 d5 2.Nf3 dxe4 3.Ng5 e5. White's third move attacks the black e4-pawn. Instead of holding on to the extra pawn, Black lets White waste a tempo to recapture and prioritizes development. The main line is4.Nxe4 f5, when Black is the one with the initiative and more control over the center.
After4...f5, Black's position is already slightly better than White's. However, the unaware Black player can err by overextending after5.Ng3 f4, which White can meet with6.Qh5+and force Black to give up castling rights.
After accepting White's gambit, Black can develop a piece and try to hold on to the extra pawn with the moves1.e4 d5 2.Nf3 dxe4 3.Ng5 Nf6. White can continue with the most popular4.Nc3, or the close second4.Bc4—which, objectively, is White's best choice.
Black can meet the Tennison with the engine-approved approach:1.e4 d5 2.Nf3 dxe4 3.Ng5 Bf5. Black develops the bishop and protects their extra pawn. White has no way of winning the pawn back, and Black's can play a solid structure that renders White's lead in development ineffective.
A common variation of the Tennison starts after1.e4 d5 2.Nf3 dxe4 3.Ng5 f5, when Black defends their extra pawn with another pawn. Although common, this move is not the best choice for Black because it weakens the h5-e8 diagonal that leads to the black king. It also fails to help the development of the black army.
White usually tries to explore the weak f7-square and kingside of their opponent with4.Bc4. If Black is not careful, White's activity can be crushing.
One of the appeals of the Tennison Gambit is that it contains a few traps that can catch the unprepared Black player off guard. Below you can see two of the most common pitfalls for Black on this opening.
According to chess author NM Bill Wall, the Tennison Gambit receives its name from Otto Tennison, who analyzed the opening in 1891. Wall mentions that the Tennison is the precursor of the Budapest Gambit, a similar-looking opening played with Black.
The Tennison never became a popular opening among strong players. However, a recent viralmeme video publishedby the Bosnian Ape Society channel on YouTube put the opening under the spotlight. The Tennison picked up further steam when chess YouTuber IMLevy Rozmanpublished avideoanalyzing it.

## The Three Knights Game
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Three-Knights-Opening)

---

# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Knights_Game)
TheThree Knights Gameis achess openingwhich most commonly begins with the moves:
In the Three Knights Game, Black chooses to break symmetry in order to avoid the main lines of what is often considered thedrawishFour Knights Gameafter the usual 3...Nf6.
The relevantECOcode is C46.
After tries such as 3...d6 or 3...Be7, White can play 4.d4, leaving Black with a cramped position resemblingPhilidor's Defense. If Black plays 3...Bc5 instead, White can eliminate Black's outpost at e5: 4.Nxe5!Nxe5 5.d4 Bd6 6.dxe5 Bxe5. Since tournament praxis shows the line seems to favor White, Black usually plays 3...Bb4 or 3...g6, theSteinitz Defense. Continuations then are typically 3...Bb4 4.Nd5 and 3...g6 4.d4 exd4 5.Nd5.
Another alternative for Black is 3...f5!?– theWinawer Defense(orGothic Defense). Then 4.Bb5 transposes into theSchliemann variationof theRuy Lopezwith 4.Nc3.
The Three Knights is almost never seen atmasterlevel nowadays, as Black players have sought more active tries, even within the Four Knights.
The similar position with Black having moved ...Nf6 is calledPetrov's Three Knights Game, although it too usually leads to the Four Knights Game.

## Three-Pawn Gambit
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/forum/view/chess-openings/sacrafice-3-pawns-to-open)
I saw a post on a great opener (not here).
It was sacraficing 3 pawns right off the bat.The aftereffects where devistating for the person that gained the 3 pawns.
I'm a newbi, but I can't find that opening. I want to learn it.
Can someone tell me what that is?Thanks much
Hum... How to say that...
There are many ways to sacrifice three pawns in the beginning. And none leads to a playable game, as far as I know.
the top is 3 pawns the bottom 2 pawns sacrificed, both highly playable
Maybe at the OP's level, but not at mine. (This being said without contempt, I know I would have a bit of work against these, but still I am pretty sure I would score way better than against standard stuff).
shall i correct myself: both highly playable at all levels including GM level
Huh... No ?
If you find one GM game in the database for each, I would be impresssed.
I believe it's something like ...e4,e5,d4,pxp,pc3,pxp.bc4  ?   Fischer vs forget the last name...    initials--A.B
i don't have premium and am not especially good at extracting games from the database but put in the moves i gave and you'll see there are games. the first is called something like the 4 pawn gambit i think and is really hard to defend against if you're silly enough to take all the pawns the second is scotch goring double gambit (basically danish with Nf3 and Nc6 inserted which makes it much more sound and has a 66% win for white in the database of 36 games if accepted (although only a 53% win for white overall of 410 games as most decline the second pawn), i can't provide stats for the first gambit as i'm not premium, that sound ok mr irontiger????
No.
I asked from a GM database, not on a master's game database where you find 1.Na3 scoring 90% (in chess.com database, yes) because it is played by Kramnik vs. a random CM at the first round of tournaments to save his novelty for the last three rounds.
I want one single game featuring good players ofapproximate equal strengthfrom any database you like (not chess.com's if you don't want it).
This second one is called the Danish Gambit. Wikipedia says it's bad, but I know 1800's that play it with success.
http://www.chess.com/article/view/openings-for-tactical-players-the-danish-gambit
There's a link to an article about it in chess.com
I am sorry but I have no desire to lose my time either, and the knowledge these openings are already crappy at my level, let alone in professional play.
If you consider it refusing the debate, let it be so. Come back after growing up, and tell me more about these wonderful openings.
Danish Gambit aceptad... No Nf3
e4 e5
d4 exd4
c3 dxc3
Bc4 cxb2
Bxb2...
growing up? why are people obsessed with this idea, i've been perfectly mature even if i'm incorrect which i may well be. please take your insults elsewhere.
LOL good answer
I m thinking than Nf3 maybe...when I lose :)
....go for Black Q and than Black come for white Q... If.... Wont that variation! Black have a good game. Just my opinion. Good luck finding agressiv moves or you know knowlege!

the latest match i found was the one between pavel dimitrov (white, 2321 rating) and ante brkic (black, 2581 rating). The game ended with a win by white.
ToOran_perrett, thank you. The 2nd game was what I was looking for.
Sorry - I said 3 pawns. It was 2. If I had remembered correctly, I could have found it. One reason I'm not good at chess -- I can't remember things. :-)
Yea cause I was thinking that you meant 2 because I know nothing about a three pawn sacrifice opening or ever heard about one.
the latest match i found was the one between pavel dimitrov (white, 2321 rating) and ante brkic (black, 2581 rating). The game ended with a win by white.
Ok, I'm impressed.
Not by the result (Black declined the gambit probably out of fear of some home prep, so it's a bit easier to play as White, so that doesn't settle the matter), but by the fact someone actually played it (probably the 1-pawn way, but anyways).
OK. I'm not completely insane. The danish gambit, if I understand it correctly does sacrifice 3 pawns IF the opponent chooses to take the 3rd. The 3rd would be foolish on his part, but there is the potential for 3 pawn sacrifice.
Anyway, thank you for the answers. I'll get better, and hope to play some of you sometime soon.
shall i correct myself: both highly playable at all levels including GM level

That is one of the most famous games of morphy, not completety sound, and very old, but worthy of praise. There is not many games recent in the 3 pawn sack line.
No.
You are rude.If you not gonna answer his question then just not comment at all.

I've only gotten to use this gambit twice, but I really enjoy it and would recommend it to anyone looking to spice up a probably-already-spicy king's gambit repetoire.
I like that variation for white.
Wow black really wanted to lose that game
Just take the Knight and brazen it out on h8, it'll all be fine!!  Even better just take it on move 16 or 17!

## Traxler Counter Attack
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Italian-Game-Traxler-Counterattack)

---

# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Knights_Defense,_Traxler_Counterattack)

TheTraxler Counterattack, also known as theWilkes-Barre Variation, is achess openingthat begins with the moves:
The opening is a variation of theTwo Knights Defense[1][2]where White has chosen the offensive line 4.Ng5, immediately attacking the f7-square with the knight and bishop, and Black has replied 4...Bc5, counterattacking the f2-square. It is one of several ways Black can avoid theFried Liver Attack.[3]
The variation was first seen in the game J. Reinisch–Karel Traxlerplayed inHostouňin 1890.[4]Later it was named afterWilkes-Barre, PennsylvaniabyFrank Marshall, who claimed to be first to analyze and publish it, so today 4...Bc5 is known as both the Traxler Variation[4]and (in the United States and the United Kingdom[5]only) the Wilkes-Barre Variation.[6][7]
The opening is classified as code C57 in theEncyclopaedia of Chess Openings.
This is an extremely natural move and the whole point of Ng5. The knight is defended by the bishop on c4, and isforkingthe black queen and rook. But now the shocking sacrifice 5...Bxf2+!!(diagram) will draw out the white king and bring the black queen into play with gain of time.[8][9]
If White captures the bishop, Black can continue the attack with 6...Nxe4+, after which Kg1 and Ke3 are considered the best moves (as moving the king to any square where it can becheckedcan lead to a decisive attack for Black), both of which are usually followed up by ...Qh4.[10]If White blunders by taking the rook on h8, a common beginner mistake, mate in four follows: 8...Qf4+ 9.Ke2 (9.Kd3 Nb4+ 10.Ke2 Qf2#) Qf2+ 10.Kd3 Nb4+ 11.Kxe4 Qf4#.
The best move after Bxf2+ is 6.Kf1,[11]as the white king can no longer be checked, forcing Black to play Qe7 moving out of danger, and allowing White to capture the rook. After 7...d5! 8.exd5 Nd4, however, Black still has a strong attack, but White maintains advantage after 9.d6![10]
This move is preferred by most modern masters, winning a pawn and avoiding the complications that arise after 5.Nxf7 Bxf2+. After 5...Ke7 (better than Kf8 as Black should free the f-file for theking's rook), White should move the bishop again since if it stays on f7, Black can play h6 attacking the knight andunderminingthe defense of the bishop. White is considered to have a slight edge, but lagging indevelopmentdue to having to move the bishop and knight multiple times. The absence of the f7-pawn may also be used in Black's favor, as the rook will be active on f8 and the idea Qe8–g6(–h5) is a new possibility.[12][13][11][10]
The main line continues with 6.Bd5 (also possible are 6.Bb3 and 6.b4), which is often given an exclamation mark by theory books. This precise move gives rise to the possibility of future Bxc6 as well asoverprotectingthe e4-pawn. Black has a chance to exchange knight for bishop but the knight exchange reduces Black's counterattacking chances. Black can now develop the rook to f8, threatening to win the f2-pawn by Bxf2+, Kxf2 and Nxd5+discovered check.[14][15]

## Trompowsky Attack
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Trompowsky-Attack)
The Trompowsky Attack is an offbeat 1.d4 opening for White as a response to Black's 1...Nf6. A newer opening, the Trompowsky is light on theory but still offers White good attacking chances. It also avoids some of the heavily theoretical lines of other openings. As such, it is a good opening for players of every level.
TheTrompowskyAttackstarts after the moves1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5. White develops their dark-squared bishop on the second move and attacks Black's knight. White immediately threatens to take the knight to damage Black's pawn structure. Black can either let White double their pawns or avoid it, as both lines are perfectly playable.
The Trompwoski is a good way for White to avoid a few lines against 1.d4 that are dense in theory. It's also a way for White to catch some Black players off guard. Although there are aggressive lines for White, there are also some very positional lines where White simply exchanges their dark-squared bishop and places their central pawns on dark squares with an extremely solid position. This approach is similar to some Torre Attack and London System setups. These options for White make it an attractive choice for players of all playing styles.
The Trompowsky Attack's theory is not nearly as large as 1.d4 openings such as the Queen's Gambit, King's Indian Defense, and others. Black's second move dictates much of the theory, as Black can either ignore White's threat or respond to it in various ways. Below you can see the main variations of the Trompowsky.
The most popular variation of the Trompowsky happens with the moves1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5 Ne4. Black "violates" an opening principle by moving the knight twice, knowing that White will have to waste a tempo of their own not to lose their bishop.

The second-most popular variation of the Tromposky occurs with the moves1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5 e6. Black's second move facilitates the development of their dark-squared bishop. It also avoids the doubling of the pawns on the f-file since the black queen defends the f6-knight.
The downside to Black's move is that White can immediately take more of the center with e2-e4.
After1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5 d5, Black ignores White's threat and expands in the center. White can transpose into the Veresov Attack (3.Nc3), the Torre Attack (3.Nf3), or stay in the Tromposky with 3.Bxf6. Black's will usually recapture with 3...exf6, when their doubled f-pawns make the kingside less flexible but also give Black more central space for their pieces.
White will usually develop their light-squared bishop with a fianchetto on g2 and attack the queenside or fight for the center immediately with c2-c4.
Another variation of the Tromposky begins after the moves1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5 c5. Black once again invites White to take their knight to double their pawns. White will usually take the knight, and Black will recapture with 3...gxf6, preparing to build a strong center. White can also ignore Black's tease and advance their d-pawn to try to cramp Black's position. These are some of the sharpest lines in this opening.
Black can also opt for the variation that starts after1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5 g6. Black again ignores White's attack on their knight and prepares to fianchetto their dark-squared bishop on g7. If White wants to stay in the Trompowsky, they'll usually take the knight and force Black to double their pawns.
Once more, White's plans will either revolve around developing their light-squared bishop on g2 and attacking the queenside or playing the c2-c4 push immediately.
The Trompowsky Attack is a relatively new opening and received its name after the 1939 Brazilian champion Octavio Trompowsky. He helped popularize this opening from the 1920s through the 1940s when he played it in numerous tournaments against strong grandmasters.
The opening gained traction during that period since the move 2.Bg5 caught many masters by surprise. In 1941, Trompowsky wrote that White's second move allowed him to "escape from the books and face masters more or less with equal weapons."
After the 1940s, masters have used the opening only sporadically. Curiously, from 1990 onward, the Tromposky had a resurgence in popularity. Notable players like GMAntoaneta Stefanovaoften play the opening, and even GMMagnus Carlsenused it against GMSergey Karjakinduring their 2016 world championship match.

The Trompowsky is a popular alternative to the more common lines after 1.d4 Nf6 beginning 2.c4 or 2.Nf3. By playing 2.Bg5, White sidesteps immense bodies ofopening theoryof variousIndian Defenceslike theQueen's Indian,King's Indian,Nimzo-Indian, as well as theGrünfeld Defence.
The opening is named after the one-time Brazilian championOctávio Trompowsky(1897–1984) who played it in the 1930s and 1940s.[1]Chess masterKarel Opočenský(1892–1975) also played it in the 1930s, and the opening is also known as the Opočenský Opening.[2]Also,chess masterWilliam Allen Ruth developed the opening simultaneously in the 1930s, and it was well-known by locals in Pennsylvania as the Ruth Opening. The Trompowsky has also been called the Zot.
Julian Hodgson,Antoaneta Stefanova, andArjun Erigaisiare among severalgrandmasterswho often employ the Trompowsky. World ChampionMagnus Carlsenhas occasionally employed the Trompowsky, notably in the first game of the2016 World Chess ChampionshipagainstSergey Karjakin.
Black has a number of ways to meet the Trompowsky, some of which avoid doubled pawns, while others allow them. The most common Black responses are discussed here.
White can also play 2.Bg5 after 1.d4 d5. This is known as the Pseudo-Trompowsky,Hodgson Attack, Levitsky Attack, Queen's Bishop Attack, and Bishop Attack, and is covered inECOcode D00. Play transposes to the Trompowsky if Black plays 2...Nf6.

## Veresov Attack

The Veresov Attack is not the typical 1.d4-opening. White goes for fast development and often the players castle on opposite sides of the board. White's play revolves around the e4-square - often he tries to push through e2-e4.

TheRichter–Veresov Attack(orVeresov Opening) is achess openingthat begins with the moves:
It is also often reached by transposition, for example 1.d4 Nf6 2.Nc3 d5 3.Bg5 (the most common move order), 1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5 d5 3.Nc3, or 1.Nc3 Nf6 2.d4 d5 3.Bg5.
The opening was named after the GermanInternational MasterKurt Richterand later the Soviet masterGavriil Veresov, who played it frequently for over a quarter of a century.
Along with theTrompowsky Attack,Colle System,London System, andTorre Attack, the Richter–Veresov Attack is one of the more common branches of theQueen's Pawn Game. The Richter–Veresov Attack looks like the more popularRuy Lopezopening mirrored on thequeenside, but the dynamics of play are quite different.
TheEncyclopaedia of Chess Openingscode for the Richter–Veresov Attack is D01.
The opening dates back as far as the gameMarshall–Wolf, Monte Carlo 1902. However, it wasSavielly Tartakowerwho played it regularly in the 1920s and even to the end of his life, using it in his victory overDonnerat Staunton Centenary 1951. Tartakower's interpretation and treatment of the opening generally led to a closed, manoeuvring game.
Kurt Richter was the next player to develop new ideas in the opening, during the 1930s. He mostly found it useful to facilitate his risk-taking style, and he produced some dazzling victories which contributed to a whole chapter of his book of best games. Some theoreticians refer to the opening as the Richter Attack.
It was Gavriil Veresov, however, who greatly strengthened both the theory and practice of the opening from World War II to his heyday in the 1950s and 1960s. He is credited with demonstrating that the opening contained more subtlety and depth than was previously considered, often culminating in a central advance or direct assault on the enemy king. As a tool for rapid piece development, it resembled aking pawnopening, and required fewer pawn moves than standardqueen pawnfare.
The opening has never been very popular at the top level, though various prominent players have employed it on occasion. In 1959, for example,David Bronsteinplayed the Richter Attack against Veresov himself.[1]
Moving into the last third of the 20th century, grandmasters of the calibre ofSpassky,Tal,Smyslov,Larsen, and Bronstein all experimented with the Veresov Opening as an occasional surprise weapon. EvenKarpovemployed it with success againstRomanishinin a Soviet Team Championship. Other, more frequent practitioners have includedHéctor Rossetto,Lev Alburt,Victor Ciocaltea,Nikola Padevsky, andTony Miles.
In more contemporary play, the system has remained popular. GrandmasterJonny Hectorhas become an adherent of the Veresov and some interest has also been shown by leading GMAlexander Morozevich.
After 3.Bg5 (diagram), Black's most popular choices are 3...Nbd7, 3...e6, 3...Bf5, 3...c6, and 3...c5, all potentially leading to different variations. White's plans typically include rapid queenside castling and an early f3 and e4.
After the Black reply 3...Bf5, Richter usually continued 4.f3, intending to build a largepawn centre; Veresov, on the other hand, usually played 4.Bxf6, damaging the black pawn structure. Today, these two lines are known, respectively, as the Richter Variation[2]and Veresov Variation.[3]

## Vienna Game
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Vienna-Game)
The Vienna Game is a 1.e4 opening for White. Compared to other 1.e4 openings, the Vienna is much less common but theoretically sound. Because of this, it can be an excellent weapon for beginners to catch their opponents by surprise. The Vienna is also suitable for more experienced players, with GMs likeViswanathan Anandand Alexander Shabalov among the players who have played it.
TheVienna Gamestarts after the moves1.e4 e5 2.Nc3. Instead of the more common 2.Nf3, White chooses to develop the queenside knight. White's second move allows for a quick f2-f4 pawn-push. It also keeps the d1-h5 diagonal open for the queen, which can go to f3 or h5.
The Vienna Game is not as common or as old as other 1.e4 openings. For this reason, it is also not heavy in theory. Black has three main responses to the Vienna on their second move: 3...Nf6, 3...Nc6, and 3...Bc5.
Black's most popular response to the Vienna game is the Falkbeer Variation, which starts after1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Nf6. Black develops a knight and puts pressure on the white e4-pawn. Black's last move also helps them play the d7-d5 push if White plays the Vienna Gambit (discussed shortly).
From this position, White can opt for an aggressive or a positional approach.
The Mieses Variation is the most popular line of the Falkbeer. This variation starts after1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.g3, when White goes for a more positional game. White intends to fianchetto their light-squared bishop on g2 to increase their control over the central d5- and e4-squares. Black mostly goes for the immediate central counterstrike with d7-d5 but can also play a slower game by developing their pieces.
Another popular way for White to continue in the Falkbeer Variation is with the Vienna Gambit. After the moves1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.f4, White immediately challenges Black's central control. The Vienna Gambit resembles the King's Gambit, with the added benefit that Black no longer has easy access to White's weakened e1-h4 diagonal due to the f6-knight.
White usually develops their light-squared bishop on c4 or b5, their knight to f3, and castles kingside. Usually, White will use the semi-open f-file and active pieces to attack the kingside.
Although not as common among grandmasters anymore, the Vienna Gambit is still a good weapon for club-level players.
The Max Lange Defense starts after the moves1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Nc6. Black follows White's lead and develops the queenside knight, supporting their e5-pawn. The game can then transpose to the Three Knights Opening if White plays 3.Nf3. White can also stay in the Vienna by developing their light-squared bishop on b5, c4, or g2.
Black can also enter the Anderssen Defense with the moves1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Bc5. Black makes a useful developing move, bringing their kingside bishop into the game. Although not nearly as popular as the other variations, this is still a sound way of playing with Black against the Vienna. Former world championJose Raul Capablancaused to play this variation to avoid theory.
The Vienna Game is relatively new when compared to other openings. Even though there are records of games with this opening as early as 1846, it didn't catch up in popularity until the beginning of the 1900s. Masters based in Vienna, Austria, were among its leading proponents—Wilhelm Steinitz,Rudolf Spielmann, andSavielly Tartakower.
The opening remained relatively popular until the end of the 1920s when its usage started declining. By the end of the 1930s, few masters still played the Vienna regularly, and from that moment on, the opening rarely appeared at the elite level play.
Today, the opening is still common at the club level, but not so much among masters. However, you can still see grandmasters playing this opening sporadically.

TheVienna Gameis anopeninginchessthat begins with the moves:
White's second move is less common than 2.Nf3, and is also more recent.
The original idea behind the Vienna Game was to play a delayedKing's Gambitwith f4 (the Vienna Gambit), but in modern play White often plays morequietly(for example, byfianchettoinghis king's bishop with g3 and Bg2). Black most often continues with2...Nf6. The opening can also lead to theFrankenstein–Dracula Variation.
Weaver W. Adamsfamously claimed that the Vienna Game led to aforced winfor White.[1]Nick de Firmianconcludes in the 15th edition ofModern Chess Openings, however, that the opening leads toequalitywithbest playby both sides.[2]
White has three main options: 3.f4, 3.Bc4, and 3.g3. Note that 3.Nf3transposesto thePetrov'sThree Knights Game, which after 3...Nc6 leads to theFour Knights Game.
Atgrandmasterlevel, the gambit move 3.f4 is considered too risky an opening.[3]It is best met by 3...d5, striking back in the center. The variation 4.fxe5 Nxe4 5.Qf3 has been popularised by the International Master and chess streamerLevy Rozmanbut this variation is well met by 5...Nc6, with the point 6.Nxe4 Nd4. Also possible is 5.d3, but the normal continuation is 5.Nf3. White obtains open lines and attacking chances, but Black can usually hold the balance with correct play.
Lines other than 3...d5 give White at least an edge, however, making this a good choice for aggressive play at lower levels, where opponents are unlikely to know that 3...d5 is best.
The gambit should not be accepted, since 3...exf4 4.e5 Qe7 5.Qe2 forces Black's knight to retreat with 5...Ng8, and after 6.Nf3, Black must be careful not to lose on the spot, for example after 6...d6? 7.Nd5!, when the dual ideas of Nxc7 and exd6 will win the game quickly. Retreating immediately with 4...Ng8 is better, but after 5.Nf3 with the idea of d4 followed by Bxf4, White has a nice game.
Other lines for Black include 3...d6 4.Nf3 Nc6 5.Bb5 Bd7 6.d3, when the threat of Bxc6 followed by taking on e5 induces 6...exf4 7.Bxf4, leaving White with a pleasant position; and also 3...Nc6? 4.fxe5! Nxe5 5.d4, when both 5...Nc6 and 5...Ng6 are met by 6.e5 with a winning advantage to White. Material is not as important as the attack in this position, so White should not be afraid to sacrifice.
The move 3.Bc4 leads to a position which can also be reached from theBishop's Opening(1.e4 e5 2.Bc4). Black has several choices here; 3...Bc5 can transpose to theKing's Gambit Declinedafter 4.d3 d6 5.f4 Nc6 6.Nf3; 3...Nc6 4.d3, 4...Na5, 4...Bc5 or 4...d6 are all playable; 3...Bb4 4.f4 Nxe4 5.Qh5 0-0 leads to wild but probably equal play, according to de Firmian inMCO-15.[4]
3...Nxe4, 4.Qh5 (threatening Qxf7#) 4...Nd6 5.Bb3 when Black can either go for the relatively quiet waters of 5...Be7 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Nxe5 g6 8.Qe2 (or 8.Nxc6 dxc6 9.Qe5 0-0) Nd4 9.Qd3 Nxb3 10.axb3 Nf5 11.0-0 d6, which led to equality inAnand–Ivanchuk,Roquebrune1992.[5]Or the complexities of 5...Nc6 6.Nb5 g6 7.Qf3 f5 8.Qd5 Qe7 9.Nxc7+ Kd8 10.Nxa8 b6, which the Irish correspondence chess player and theoristTim Hardingextravagantly dubbed "theFrankenstein–Dracula Variation".[6]4.Nxe4 d5forksbishop and knight is fine for Black.[5]4.Bxf7+ is weak; after 4...Kxf7 5.Nxe4 d5!(inferior is 5...Nc6 6.Qf3+, when Black cannot play 6...Kg8??because of 7.Ng5!1–0Davids–Diggle, London Banks League 1949, while 6...Ke8 leaves the king awkwardly placed in the center)[7][8]6.Qf3+ (6.Qh5+ g6 7.Qxe5?Bh6! wins for Black)[9]Kg8 7.Ng5!?(hoping for 7...Qxg5?? 8.Qxd5+ andmatenext move, Schottlaender–Ed. Lasker, simultaneous exhibition, Breslau c. 1902) Qd7!, with a large advantage for Black in view of hisbishop pairand pawn center.[10][11]
The move 3.g3, the Mieses Variation, is a quiet continuation in which White fianchettoes his king's bishop, a line played byVasily Smyslovon a few occasions, most notably in a win overLev Polugaevskyin the 1961 USSR Championship. That game continued 3...d5 4.exd5 Nxd5 5.Bg2 Be6 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.0-0 Be7 8.Re1 Bf6 9.Ne4 0-0 10.d3 Be7 11.a3 Nb6 12.b4, resulting in a position which theEncyclopaedia of Chess Openingsassesses as slightly better for White. The main line today, however, is considered to be 5...Nxc3 6.bxc3 Bd6 7.Nf3 0-0 8.0-0. A major alternative for Black is 3...Bc5 (3...Nc6 normally transposes into one of the other lines).
In addition to these lines, the late AmericanmasterAriel Mengarini advocated the whimsical 3.a3, sometimes called Mengarini's Opening. It is not a serious try for advantage, but is essentially a useful waiting move that gives White an improved version of Black's position after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6. First, the "ReversedRuy Lopez" with 3...Bb4 is ruled out. Second, after 3...d5, 4.exd5 Nxd5 5.Qh5!? gives White an improved version of theSteinitzVariation of theScotch Game, since Black can never play ...Nb4, an important idea for White in the mirror-image position. Third, after 3...Bc5, 4.Nf3 gives a reversedTwo Knights Defense. Then the typical 4...Ng4 may be met by 5.d4 exd4 6.Na4, when 6...Bb4+, White's usual move in the mirror-image position, is impossible. After 4...Ng4, White may also play improved versions of the Ulvestad Variation (6.b4 in the above line) and Fritz Variation (6.Nd5 c6 7.b4), since when White plays b4 his pawn is protected, unlike in the mirror-image position. If Black plays more quietly with 3...Bc5 4.Nf3 Nc6, then 5.Nxe5! Nxe5 6.d4 gives White some advantage. The best line for Black may be 3...Bc5 4.Nf3 d5 5.exd5 0-0 (better than 5...e4 6.d4, when the normal 6...Bb4 is impossible), and if 6.Nxe5, 6...Re8 7.d4 Bxd4! 8.Qxd4 Nc6, as in the mirror-image line. Also possible is 3...Bc5 4.Nf3 d6, when Black stands well after 5.Bc4 Be6, while 5.d4 cxd4 6.Nxd4 gives White little or no advantage.
White again has three main options, 3.Bc4, 3.f4, and 3.g3. Note that 3.Nf3 transposes to theThree Knights Game, which after 3...Nf6 leads to theFour Knights Game.
In the Vienna Gambit, defined by the moves 1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.f4, White sacrifices a pawn to gaincontrol of the center.
The Hamppe–Muzio Gambit (or Vienna Hamppe–Muzio Gambit) is characterised by the continuation 3...exf4 4.Nf3 g5 5.Bc4 g4 6.0-0 gxf3 7.Qxf3 (see diagram).
As with its close relative, the sharpMuzio Gambit, White sacrifices the knight on f3 in return for a powerful attack against the black king. It is named after Austrian theoreticianCarl Hamppeand classified underECOcode C25. TheDuboisVariation continues 7...Ne5 8.Qxf4 Qf6.
6.d4 is the Pierce Gambit.
The Steinitz Gambit, 1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.f4 exf4 4.d4, was a favorite ofWilhelm Steinitz, the firstWorld Champion. White allows Black to misplace White's king with 4...Qh4+ 5.Ke2 (see diagram), hoping to prove that White's pawn center and the exposed position of Black's queen are more significant factors. Unlike Steinitz, who famously opined that, "The King is a fighting piece!", few modern players are willing to expose their king this way. The Steinitz Gambit is thus rarely seen today.
Louis Paulsenplayed 1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 four times with the white pieces – games against Meitner, Rosenthal, Gelbfuhs, and Bird in theVienna 1873 chess tournament. Three wins with the variation 1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.g3 named the "Paulsen Variation" of the Vienna Game, and the fourth win after 1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Bc5 3.Nf3 vs. Henry Bird.[12]
Most often, White plays 3.Bc4, when the solid 3...Nf6 transposes to the 2...Nf6 3.Bc4 Nc6 line. Weaker is 3.Bc4 Bc5, when 4.Qg4! is awkward to meet. 4...Kf8 and 4...g6 are thought the best moves, but neither is too appealing for Black. The natural 4...Qf6?? loses to 5.Nd5! Qxf2+ 6.Kd1, when White's king is in no real danger, and White has multiple threats:  7.Qxg7; 7.Nxc7+; and 7.Nh3 Qd4 8.d3 threatening to trap Black's queen with 9.c3.[13]
This is an offbeat butplayablealternative, as played (for example) by former world championJosé Raúl CapablancaagainstIlya Kanat Moscow 1936.[14]Some possible moves are 3.Bc4, 3.Nf3, and 3.f4. With move 3.Bc4, ...Nf6 and ...Nc6 can be found above, or Black can play ...d6.
White can continue with 3.Nf3, and if the move 3...Nc6?!(transposing to theThree Knights Game) 4.Nxe5! Nxe5 5.d4 Bd6 6.dxe5 Bxe5 7.Bd3 leads to a large advantage for White.[15]Stronger is 3...d6! Then 4.Na4 Nd7 5.d3 Ngf6 6.Be2 0-0 7.0-0 c6 8.Nxc5 Nxc5 9.Ne1 Ne6 10.c3 d5 is about even.[16]The main line runs 4.d4 exd4 5.Nxd4 Nf6 6.Bg5 (6.Be2 d5 7.e5 Ne4 8.0-0 Nxc3 leads to equality[16]) h6 7.Bh4 0-0 8.Nb3 and now de Firmian inMCO-15gives 8...Bb4 9.Bd3 Re8 10.0-0 Bxc3 11.bxc3 g5! 12.Bg3 Nxe4, when Black's "chances are at least equal".[16]
After 3.f4, ...d6 leads to theKing's Gambit Declined.[16]Weak is 3.Qg4 Nf6! 4.Qxg7 Rg8 5.Qh6 Bxf2+ when Black had a large advantage in Tsikhelashvili–Karpov, USSR 1968, since 6.Kxf2?? Ng4+ would win White's queen.[16]Another offbeat possibility is 3.Na4, the Hamppe Variation,[17]when 3...Bxf2+! 4.Kxf2 Qh4+ 5.Ke3 Qf4+ 6.Kd3 d5 leads to wild complications favoring Black, as in the famousImmortal Drawgame Hamppe–Meitner, Vienna 1872. The quiet 3...Be7, however, leaves Black with a good game.[18]

## Wing Gambit
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Sicilian-Defense-Wing-Gambit)

# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_Gambit)
Inchess, aWing Gambitis anopeningin which White plays an early b4, deflecting an enemypawnorbishopfrom c5 so as to regain control of d4, an important central square. (Or in which Black plays ...b5, but Wing Gambits offered by Black are very rare.)
The most common Wing Gambit is in theSicilian Defence(1.e4 c5 2.b4). The most important Wing Gambit is theEvans Gambit(1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.b4), treated separately.
The Wing Gambit in theSicilian Defenceruns 1.e4 c5 2.b4 (diagram). After Black takes with 2...cxb4, the usual continuation is 3.a3 bxa3 (3...d5! is more recently considered superior, when White must avoid 4.exd5 Qxd5 5.axb4?? Qe5+ winning the rook, a blunder actually seen in tournament play in Shirazi–Peters, Berkeley 1984; instead 5.Nf3 is better) and now the main line is 4.Nxa3, though 4.Bxa3 and 4.d4 are also seen. It is also possible to decline (or at least delay acceptance of) the gambit with 2...d5.
For his pawn, White gets quicker development and a central advantage, but it is not generally considered one of White's better choices against the Sicilian and it is virtually never seen at the professional level.  Amongst amateurs it is more common, though still not so popular as other systems.
After Black's 2...cxb4, another popular third move alternative for White is 3.d4.GMsGeorge Koltanowski,David Bronsteinand World ChampionAlexander Alekhinehave played this line.
White can postpone the gambit one move by playing the Wing Gambit Deferred, playing 2.Nf3 followed by 3.b4. The deferred Wing Gambit is considered to be best when black responds 2...e6.[1]The Portsmouth Gambit runs 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.b4, where Black is disinclined to refuse the gambit due to the positional threat 4.b5, displacing the knight and disrupting Black's smooth development.
It is also possible to prepare the gambit by playing 2.a3!? followed by 3.b4.
There is one Wing Gambit in theFrench Defence; 1.e4 e6 2.Nf3 d5 3.e5 c5 4.b4, although this is quite rare. A related idea is found in theCaro-Kann Defenceafter 1.e4 c6 2.Ne2 d5 3.e5 c5 4.b4, however Black can immediately achieve an advantage by playing 4...d4! (this move is also strong in the second French line given above). Even rarer is the Wing Gambit in theBishop's Opening, 1.e4 e5 2.Bc4 Bc5 3.b4, which has some resemblance to theEvans Gambit.
There are several other "Wing Gambits" in various openings, but they are very rare, and not as notable as the openings mentioned above:
Lutz vs.De Firmian,Biel19931.e4 c5 2.b4 cxb4 3.a3 d5! 4.exd5 Qxd5 5.Nf3 e5 6.axb4 Bxb4 7.c3 Be7 8.Na3 Nf6 9.Nb5 Qd8 10.Nxe5 Nc6 11.Nxc6 bxc6 12.Qf3 Bd7 13.Nd4 0-0 14.Ba6 Qc7 15.h3 c5 16.Nf5 Qe5 17.Ne3 Bd6 18.Be2 Bc7 19.Nc4 Qe6 20.Qe3 Ne4 21.0-0 Rfe8 22.Bd3 f5 23.Re1 Qd5 24.Qf3 Bb5 25.Nb2 c4 26.Bf1 Bb6 27.Nd1 f4 28.Qxf4 Nxf2 29.Ne3 Nd3 30.Bxd3 Qxd3 31.Kh1 Re4 32.Qg5 Bc6 33.Bb2 Qxd2 34.Rad1 Rxe3 25.Rxd2 Rxh3# 0–1[1]
