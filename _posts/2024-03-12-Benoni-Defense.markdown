## Benoni Defense
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Benoni-Defense)
The Benoni Defense is a fighting way for Black to respond to White's 1.d4. The Benoni is a common opening among club-level players and an excellent weapon for aggressive players. Although not as common among elite grandmasters, many strong grandmasters have utilized the Benoni throughout their careers. Its most prominent follower was former world champion GMMikhail Tal, who won fantastic attacking games in the opening.
The Benoni Defense is characterized by an early c7-c5 push by Black in response to White's d2-d4. Today, players mostly reach the Benoni via the sequence1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5.
Black immediately creates imbalances in the position, which leads to more decisive games. Black concedes White a space advantage in the center, giving them more freedom to maneuver their pieces. Black gets more active play on the dark squares and an extra queenside pawn that can be dangerous if properly mobilized.
There are quite a few systems Black can choose from to play the Benoni, each leading to a specific kind of game. Below you can see the main variations of the Benoni.
The Old Benoni starts after the moves1.d4 c5. Black immediately plays ...c5 without any preparatory or developing move. If White takes the pawn, Black can regain it without trouble after moves like ...Qa5+, ...Na6, or ...e6. If White advances the d-pawn instead, players reach the main line of the Old Benoni.
As the name indicates, this variation is not as common as it used to be, with players preferring to develop the f-knight before pushing the c-pawn.
The Modern Benoni occurs with the moves1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5. Black develops their f-knight and waits for White's second move before showing their cards. Black's 2...c5 threatens to exchange a wing pawn for White's central d-pawn, so White usually responds with 3.d5.
If White does play 3.d5, they gain space in the center of the board but leave weak dark squares behind. Black can take advantage of these dark-square weaknesses by developing their dark-squared bishop to g7.
The Czech Benoni happens after the moves1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e5. Black plays for a closed, slower game since taking the pawn en passant with 4.dxe6 would give Black a strong center and a slight advantage. The resulting pawn structure will cause both players to have a bad bishop. Black will usually play for the f7-f5 or the b7-b5 break, while White will try to prevent those plans and cramp their opponent's position.

The Snake Benoni starts after the moves1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 c5 4.d5 exd5 5.cxd5 Bd6. Black's 5...Bd6 may seem optically strange, but it allows the dark-squared bishop to control the e5-square. This move makes it more difficult for White to carry out the thematic Benoni e4-e5 break.
Black can maneuver the bishop with Bd6-c7-a5 to pressure White's kingside in this variation. Another plan for Black involves quickly castling, activating the rook with ...Re8, and dropping the bishop back to f8.
TheBenko Gambitis the most popular line of the Benoni, and it starts after the moves1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 b5. Black sacrifices a pawn to get quick and easy development. Black also enjoys good counterplay on the queenside if White decides to accept the gambit.
Many lines and ideas stem from Black's third move. To read more about the Benko Gambit, clickhere.
The Benoni Defense was first analyzed in 1825 by Aaron Reinganum. Reinganum published a book analyzing responses to the Queen's Gambit and King's Gambit. The book was calledBen-Oni oder die Vertheidigungen gegen die Gambitzüge im Schache(Ben-Oni, or the defenses against the Gambit moves in chess).
Reinganum explained that he named the book Ben-Oni, a Hebrew name that means "son of my sorrow" because he wrote about chess to "take refuge from melancholy." Ben-Oni was not related to the opening itself but was the name of his writings about gambits.
In the book, he analyzed Black's 1...c5 as an answer to White's 1.e4. This defense was employed in 1843 byPierre de Saint-Amantin his unofficial world championship match againstHoward Staunton. Saint-Amant later wrote: "This start is not favorable to the second player. Benoni gives a few examples; but it wastes the first player's time, depriving them of all the advantages of a good opening."
Eventually, 1.d4 c5 became known as the Old Benoni. The opening was later improved by masters, who preferred delaying the c7-c5 push. The Benoni then rose to popularity in the 1950s and 60s thanks to the efforts of GMMikhail Tal. Its fighting nature and tactical games made it a popular choice among good tacticians, with players like GMBobby Fischerand GMGarry Kasparovincluding it in their repertoire.
Although not as common in elite-level play as it used to be, the Benoni is very popular among club-level players.

TheBenoni Defense, or simply theBenoni, is achess openingcharacterized by an early reply of ...c5 against White's opening move 1.d4.
The original form of the Benoni, now known as theOld Benoni, is characterized by
This leaves Black a few options such as an early ...f5 and an early dark-squared bishop trade by ...Be7-g5, but has the drawback that White is no longer committed to playing c2-c4 after the response 2.d5. White may prefer to occupy c4 with a knight, or to inconvenience Black's development with an early bishop check on b5.
More commonly, it is reached by the sequence:
Black can then offer a pawnsacrificewith 3...b5 (theBenko Gambit), otherwise 3...e6 is the most common move, leading to theModern Benoni. 3...d6 or 3...g6 are also seen, typicallytransposingto main lines, or to lines of theKing's Indian Defense.
Benoni(or "Ben-Oni")בֶּן־אוֹנִיis an ancient Hebrew name, still occasionally used, meaning "son of my sorrow". It is a reference to the Biblical account of the dyingRachelgiving birth toBenjamin, whom she named Ben-Oni.(Genesis 35:18)
In 1825 Aaron Reinganum, a prominent member of theFrankfurt Jewish community, published a book entitledBen-Oni oder die Vertheidigungen gegen die Gambitzüge im Schachein which he analyzed several defenses to the King's Gambit and the Queen's Gambit, as well as the then unknown opening 1.d4 c5. Reinganum, who studied chess to alleviate hisdepression, conceived the name "Ben-Oni" as a nickname for his writings rather than the name of an opening.[1]
In the 1843Staunton–Saint Amantmatch, Saint Amant met 1.d4 with 1...c5 in the second and fourth games. Saint Amant wrote inLe Palamède(1843): "This opening is not favorable to Black. Bennoni [sic] gives some examples; but it loses time to White, which deprives Black of all the advantages of a good opening."[2]Staunton wrote inThe Chess-Player's Companion(1849): "M. St. Amant derived this somewhat bizarre defense from Benoni. (Benoni, oder Vertheidigungen die Gambitzüge im Schache, &c. Von Aaron Reinganum, Frankfort, 1825.)"[3]Staunton also mentions "Ben-Oni" while commenting on the move 1...c5 inThe Chess-player's Handbook(1847, page 382).
Subsequently, the name "Benoni" came to be associated with the opening 1.d4 c5, and later with 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 and other openings in which Black counters d2–d4 with an early ....c7–c5, without first having played ...d7–d5.
The Old Benoni Defense starts with 1.d4 c5. White usually replies 2.d5 in order to gainspace, as 2.dxc5 e6 leads to no advantage, and 2.e4 transposes to theMorra Gambit, also promisingequalityat best. The Old Benoni may transpose to the Czech Benoni, but there are a few independent variations. This form has never attracted serious interest in high-level play, thoughAlexander AlekhinedefeatedEfim Bogoljubowwith it in one game of their second match, in 1934. The Old Benoni is sometimes called the Blackburne Defense after EnglishmanJoseph Henry Blackburne, the first player known to have used it successfully.[4]
In the Czech Benoni, also known as the Hromadka Benoni, afterKarel Hromádka, Black plays 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e5. The Czech Benoni is moresolidthan the Modern Benoni, but also more passive. Themiddlegamesarising from this line are characterized by much maneuvering; in most lines, Black will look to break with ...b7–b5 or ...f7–f5 after due preparation, while White may play Nc3, e4, h3, Bd3, Nf3, and g4, in order to gain space on thekingsideand prevent ...f5.[5]GrandmasterBen Finegoldoften plays this line; he notably beatMamedyarovin this variation.[6]
The Benko Gambit, also known as the Volga Gambit, begins 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 b5. Play usually continues 4.cxb5 a6 5.bxa6 Bxa6. Black sacrifices a pawn for open lines and long-term positional pressure on the queen's side.
The Modern Benoni, 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e6, is the second most common form of Benoni after theBenko Gambit. Black's intention is to play ...exd5 and create aqueensidepawnmajority, whose advance will be supported by afianchettoedbishop on g7. The combination of these two features differentiates Black's setup from the other Benoni defenses and theKing's Indian Defense, althoughtranspositionsbetween these openings are common.  The Modern Benoni is classified under theECOcodes A60–A79.
The Blumenfeld is a variant of the Modern Benoni beginning 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e6 4.Nf3 b5. While it superficially resembles the Benko Gambit, it has a different strategic goal, that being to initiate counterplay against White's pawn center rather than develop positional pressure on the queen's side.
The Snake Benoni is a variant of the Modern Benoni where the bishop is developed to d6 rather than g7. This opening was invented in 1982 byRolf Olav Martens, who gave it its name because of the sinuous movement of the bishop—in Martens's original concept, Black follows up with 6...Bc7 and sometimes ...Ba5—and because the Swedish word for "snake",orm, was ananagramof his initials.[7]Normunds Miezishas been a regular exponent of this variation.[8]Aside from Martens's plan, 6...0-0 intending ...Re8, ...Bf8 and a potential redeployment of the bishop to g7, has also been tried.[8]White appears to retain the advantage against both setups.[9]
