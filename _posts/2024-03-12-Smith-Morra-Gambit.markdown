## Smith Morra Gambit
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Sicilian-Defense-Smith-Morra-Gambit)
TheSmith-Morra Gambit(also known as the Morra Gambit) is one of the ways for White to respond to theSicilian Defense. This gambit line can lead to open, sharp games that are very dangerous for the unprepared player. Although the Smith-Morra is less common among grandmasters, it can still be an effective weapon for club-level players.
The Smith-Morra Gambit is one of White's responses to the Sicilian Defense. It starts after the moves1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3.
White attacks Black's d4-pawn, offering agambit. If Black accepts the sacrifice, White's position opens up, making it easier for them to develop their pieces to active squares, from where they'll attack mainly the weak f7-square and the center. Accepting the gambit also gives White an extratempo(after they recapture with 4.Nxc3) and better control of the center, thanks to the d4-pawn. Finally, the pawn sacrifice allows White to quickly gain control of the open c-file, which is usually one of the sources of counterplay for Black in the Sicilian Defense.
When entering the Smith-Morra Gambit, Black can accept or decline the pawn sacrifice. Below you can learn more about the main variations Black can use to face this opening.
Accepting the gambit is Black's most critical way of playing, and among masters, it usually yields better results for the prepared Black player. The main line when accepting the gambit is the Scheveningen Formation, which occurs after the moves1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 Nc6 5.Nf3 d6 6.Bc4 e6.
Black is a pawn up, but White has a clear development lead, with three developed pieces against Black's lonely knight. Black maintains a compact and flexible pawn structure in the center and will usually try to castle as fast as possible. White will try to bring their pieces to active squares, delay Black's castling, and use their piece activity to start a devastating attack.
Another popular way of accepting the gambit is with the Paulsen Formation, which happens with the moves1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 Nc6 5.Nf3 e6 6.Bc4 a6.
Black plays 6...a6 to prevent White from playing the annoying 7.Nb5, when White would be better. From there, Black usually either expands on the queenside with a quick 7...b5 or develops the kingside knight with 7...Nge7. In many cases, Black delays castling or maintains their king in the center for the rest of the game.
If Black wants to avoid a tactical game, they can decline the gambit with the Push Variation, which starts with1. e4 c5 2. d4 cxd4 3. c3 d3.
The idea behind pushing the d-pawn is to avoid taking on c3 (allowing White to gain a tempo by recapturing with the knight). This move also prevents White from playing 4.cxd4, which would give them a strong center. White can either capture Black's d3-pawn with the bishop or push their pawn to c4, going for aMaroczy Bindpawn structure.
Another way for Black to decline the gambit is to transpose into theAlapin Sicilian. The first way to achieve this is by transposing into the main line with1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 Nf6.
Black's other option is to go for a line resembling the Barmen Defense of the Alapin Sicilian, where Black develops their dark-squared bishop with a fianchetto. This line starts with the moves1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 g6.
The Smith-Morra Gambit is named after Pierre Morra and Ken Smith, who helped popularize the opening. Morra was the first to publish a booklet and a few articles analyzing the opening around 1950. Smith later published, over 30 years, nine books and 49 articles on the gambit.
Nowadays, one of the opening's biggest proponents is IM Marc Esserman. He wrote a book on the subject calledMayhem In The Morraand won a famous game using the opening against the super GMLoek van Wely.

Inchess, theSmith–Morra Gambit(or simplyMorra Gambit) is anopeninggambitagainst theSicilian Defencedistinguished by the moves:
White sacrifices apawntodevelopquickly and create attacking chances. In exchange for the gambit pawn, White has a piece developed after 4.Nxc3 and a pawn in thecenter, while Black has an extra pawn and a central pawn majority. The plan for White is straightforward and consists of placing hisbishopon c4 to attack the f7-square, and controlling both the c- and d-fileswithrooks, taking advantage of the fact that Black can hardly find a suitable place to post hisqueen.
The Smith–Morra is uncommon ingrandmastergames, but is popular at club level.[4]It does not have a definitive refutation.
The Smith–Morra is named afterPierre Morra[fr](1900–1969) from France,[5]andKen Smith(1930–1999) of theDallas Chess Club.[6]In Europe the nameMorra Gambitis preferred; other names for it, includingTartakower GambitandMatulovic Gambit, have disappeared.
Around 1950, Morra published a booklet and several articles about the Smith–Morra. Smith wrote a total of nine books and forty-nine articles about the gambit. When Smith participated in an international tournament against several top grandmasters inSan Antonioin 1972, he essayed the opening three times, againstDonald Byrne,Larry Evans, andHenrique Mecking, but lost all three games.
Many players consider the opening amateurish[citation needed]. International MasterMarc Essermanis one of its leading advocates today. Recently in April 2023,Hikaru NakamuradefeatedFabiano Caruanawith it to win the Chessable Masters.[7]
Black has a wide choice of reasonable defences after 1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3. White sometimes plays 2.Nf3 and 3.c3, which depending on Black's response may rule out certain lines.  3.Qxd4 Nc6 4.Qe3 is the Sicilian Center Game, similar to theCenter Game, 1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.Qxd4 Nc6 4.Qe3.
In return for the sacrificed pawn, White acquires a number of benefits that can be used to create active plans:
The mix of short- and long-term ideas means that the character of positions arising from this gambit can be described as a mix of theStafford Gambitand theBenko Gambit: to survive against a well-prepared White player, Black must first navigate the minefield of traps in the opening, then contend with White's long-term pressure and initiative. If Black manages to do this while holding on to the extra pawn, he/she will have good chances to win the ensuing endgame. This is not easy, however, and many Sicilian players opt to decline the gambit altogether.
This line is similar to theDanish Gambit: 4...cxb2 5.Bxb2
The latter has a bad reputation, as square c3 is free for the knight. Still 5...Nf6 (5...e5; 5...Nc6 6.Nf3 e5) 6.Nf3 e6 7.Nc3 Qd6 is likely to transpose to a main line of the Alapin: 2.c3 d5 3.exd5 Qxd5 4.d4 e6 5.Nf3 Nf6 6.Bd3 Nc6 7.0-0 cxd4 8.cxd4 Be7 9.Nc3 Qd6.
