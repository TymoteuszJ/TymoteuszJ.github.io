## Jerome Gambit
# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Gambit)
TheJerome Gambitis an unsoundchess openingwhich is an offshoot of theGiuoco Piano. It is characterized by the moves:
Whitesacrificestwopieces(and eventually regains one) for two pawns in hopes of exposing Black'skingand obtaining amating attack. The line was a brief fad in the late 19th century, but it is almost never seen today.
The opening is named after Alonzo Wheeler Jerome (1834–1902) ofPaxton, Illinois, who had a game with this opening against the problemistWilliam Shinkmanpublished in theDubuque Chess Journalin 1876.[1]Blackburnewrote of it, "I used to call this the Kentucky opening. For a while after its introduction, it was greatly favoured by certain players, but they soon grew tired of it."[2]Blackburne's name for the opening may have arisen from confusion with1.e4 e5 2.Qh5, which was also published in theDubuque Chess Journaland dubbed the "Kentucky Opening" there.
In the third edition of the openingtreatiseChess Openings, Ancient and Modern(1896), the authors wrote:
The Jerome Gambit is an American invention, and a very risky attack. It is described in the American Supplement toCook's Synopsisas unsound but not to be trifled with. The first player sacrifices two pieces for twopawns, with the chances arising from the adversary's king being displaced, and drawn into the centre of the board.[3]
Similarly,du Montwrote that it "is unsound, but has the saving grace of leading to a lively game and is therefore suitable for an occasional friendly game. The defender cannot afford to be careless."[4]
White may regain one of the two sacrificed pieces with 6.d4, but Black retains a decisivematerialadvantage with 6...Bxd4 7.Qxd4 Qf6.[5]More commonly, White plays 6.Qh5+. In that event, Freeborough and Ranken analyzed two lines. One is 6...Kf8 7.Qxe5 Qe7 8.Qf5+ Ke8 9.Nc3 d6 10.Qf3 Qf7 11.Qe2 Nh6 12.0-0 c6, with large advantage to Black.[5]Freeborough and Ranken also analyze the bold 6.Qh5+ Ke6!?("follow[ing] out Mr.Steinitz'stheory that the King is a strong piece") 7.Qf5+ Kd6 8.d4 (or 8.f4 Qf6 9.fxe5+ Qxe5) Bxd4 9.Na3 c6 10.c3 Qf6 11.cxd4 Qxf5 12.exf5 Nf7 13.Bf4+ Ke7, again with a large advantage.[5]Lines to avoid for Black after 6.Qh5+ are 6...Kf6?? 7.Qf5+ Ke7 8.Qxe5+ Kf7 9.Qxc5 and 6...Ke7?? 7.Qxe5+ followed by Qxc5, both regaining both pieces and winning two pawns.[6]

The Jerome Gambit is typically played 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.Bxf7+ Kxf7 5.Nxe5 Nxe5 6.Qh5+.
Anyone got any ideas on how to succeed with this?
There's very little chances of succeeding with that gambit, 6. .... Ke6 and White doesn't have much for the two pieces. I suggest you find something better.
6. ...Ke6 7. Qf5+ keeps the attack going. 6. ...g6 7. Qxe5 Qe7! is much better, because after 8. Qxh8 Qxe4+ Black has an attack and can almost trap the queen...

1.  "6. ...Ke6 7. Qf5+ keeps the attack going": not really, 7. .... Kd6 8 Nc3 Qf6 and White has nothing.

2. "6. ...g6 7. Qxe5 Qe7! is much better, because after 8. Qxh8 Qxe4+ Black has an attack and can almost trap the queen...": Of course, Black  does better here because you've played a bad move for White:

6. ...g6 7. Qxe5 Qe7 8. Qf4+ is better than taking the Rook.
7. ...Kd6 8. d4! Bxd4 9. Bg5 Ne7 10. Bxe7+ Qxe7 11. Na3 is still probably winning for Black, but offers White practical chances...
6. ...g6 7. Qxe5 Qe7 8. Qf4 Qf6 9. Qxf6+ Nxf6 and White is down a piece AND behind in development!

Look, it doesn't matter how you care to slice it, the gambit is completely unsound. My researches find that the gambit doesn't appear in any master databases. Probably dangerous at the beginner level but not a variation to take anyone's game forward. I stand by my original comment "Find something better".
I still feel that white can salvage the game by playing the Bietschlaap gambit.
If you insist on gambiting away a minor in the first few moves, perhaps the Halloween Gambit is a better place to start.

Agreed, especially as the subject gambit simply throws awaytwominor pieces.
If your pieces are getting in your way, just leave some of them off the board. Few opponents will complain.
I'mthrilledto see some posts on my favorite chess opening and research topic!
I'll try to answer the questions, bit by bit...
The Jerome Gambit can be fun at blitz, in informal games, or when giving odds to a weaker player.
A friend says he plays chess at a local bar and likes the Jerome Gambit because, either way, win or lose, the game is over quickly...
There is no sense in trying to "prove" that the opening is "good": it has many time-tested refutations.
For those playing the Jerome, it becomes as issue of finding the most challenging lines of play, until either the opponent collapses -- or wins.
I am reminded of a 19th century chess book that gave detailed opening analysis of pawn-and-move odds and pawn-and-two-moves odds -- both theoretically "worse" or "lost" for Black -- in order to assist the odds-givers.
If your pieces are getting in your way, just leave some of them off the board. Few opponents will complain.
I think you're on to something here.
I know a number of people who play the Jerome Gambit against players of equal strength, or of greater strength -- something I do rarely.
How many rating points difference is playing the Jerome Gambit worth? From my researches on online Jerome Gambit tournaments (turn-based, club players): Jerome Gambit + 200 points = even chances.
Relevant is Geoff Chandler's off-the-cuff Blunder Table that players under 1500, playing each other, might still get away with the Jerome...

I've been blogging about the Jerome Gambit (and its relatives) for over 1,000 consecutive days. There are plenty of tips at:jeromegambit.blogspot.com
Rest assured: all the refutations are there, as well.
There's very little chances of succeeding with that gambit, 6. .... Ke6 and White doesn't have much for the two pieces. I suggest you find something better.
Indeed, 6...Ke6 is one of the strongest replies Black can make.
It takes confidence, though, or some knowledge of the line by the defender. In my games 6...Ke6 was chosen less than 1/4 of the time by Black.
6. ...Ke6 7. Qf5+ keeps the attack going. 6. ...g6 7. Qxe5 Qe7! is much better, because after 8. Qxh8 Qxe4+ Black has an attack and can almost trap the queen...
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.Bxf7+ Kxf7 5.Nxe5+ Nxe5+ 6.Qh5+ g6 7.Qxe5and now7...d6was made famous by Blackburne in a brilliant attacking miniature of the Jerome Gambit:8.Qxh8 Qh4 9.0-0 Nf6 10.c3 Ng4 11.h3 Bxf2+ 12.Kh1 Bf5 13.Qxa8 Qxh3+ 14.gxh3 Bxe4#
The evaluation of7...d6as "Black wins" has been popular, but mistaken. Some writers have pointed out that10.Qd8!is actuallywinning for White-- but that is a mistake, too. Current assessment is that Black can force a draw.
However,7...Qe7, Whistler's Defense (played by Lt. G.N. Whistler against Alonzo Wheeler Jerome in a series of correspondence games in 1876; in later writings Jerome somehow "forgot" to mention this defense), leads to an equally-Blackburnian conflagration after8.Qxh8?as I showed in one of my Jerome Gambit Tournament games (I had the Black pieces):8...Qxe4+ 9.Kd1 Qxg2 10.Qxh7+ Kf8 11.Re1 d5 12.d4 Bg4+ 13.Kd2 Qxf2+ 14.Re2 Qxe2+ 15.Kc3 Qc4+ 16.Kd2 Qxd4+ 17.Ke1 Qd1#
I have a question for you: I have heard it said that the line 1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 Bc5 3. Bxf7+!? is ALSO known as the Jerome Gambit... can you confirm this?
Abrahams inThe Chess Mind(1951) refers to “the once popular Jerome Gambit” –1.e4 e5 2.Bc4 Bc5 3.Bxf7+.Fletcher’sGambits Accepted A Survey of Opening Sacrifices(1954) notes “Some authors have called the opening with the moves1.P-K4, P-K4; 2.B-B4, B-B4; 3.BxPch, by the name Jerome.”
I haven't found any other references (I'd be glad to see them), or any games by Alonzo Wheeler Jerome with the2.Bc4/3.Bxf7+line, either.
This is the case of an unsound gambit. You may surprise some in bullet, that's all. Good luck with it!
a) yes, you are right, it is manifestly unsound
b) certainly in bullet, but also some faster speeds like 3 0 or even 2 12 (I've played 5 12, I think)
c) Pete Banks has played the Jerome Gambit successfully over-the-board in regular club play in the U.K. -- he is much braver than I am.
d) I appreciate all the "good luck" that I can get. As the saying goes, when it comes to the Jerome Gambit, "Black wins by force, White wins by farce."
...Qf6 is often a show stopper in the Jerome Gambit -- exchanging Queens can take the life out of any attack White is trying to whip up.
As for6...Ke6 7.Qf5+ Kd6 8.Nc3 Qf6 --
Some players prefer7.f4instead of the Queen check, but then Black has the profoundly annoying7...d6(a favorite of computers the world over), simply giving back one of the pieces and draining most of the dynamism out of White's game after8.fxe5 dxe5;
I don't have much experience with7.Qf5+ Kd6 8.Nc3, so I'll have to look at that some more. Quite likely, though, as PrawnEatsPrawn says,8...Qf6is strong.
I play7.Qf5+ Kd6 8.f4, but then after8...Qh4+ 9.g3 Nf3+Black is preparing a Queen sac that will crush the first player, as a buddy of mine, Mad Dog Hailey, learned in a turn-based game in which his opponent, I think, was using computer assistance...
What can I say? It shouldn't be hard at all to "find something better" -- the Jerome Gambit makes the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit lookgood.
I will continue to research Alonzo Wheeler Jerome's (American Civil War veteran, officer in U.S.C.T., hemp farmer and inventer) opening. Any games you have uncovered or played -- I'd love to see them.
I've played the Jerome Gambit about 70 times so far here at chess.com and other sites with great success.  I first played the gambit in 2001 and still play it in 2011.  It's great for blitz chess as long as you know all the traps and the other guy doesn't have time to think and find the exact way out of this sacrifice.  Perrypawnpusher (Rick Kennedy) offers a database of thousands of Jerome Gambits (and adding Blackburne Shilling Gambits and reversed BSGs) which I have studied.  Only a few players have found the right continuation to bust this line and for Black to win, so it is good odds that you can draw or most likely win if you know the trappy lines.  And I am a guy who studies and plays for trappy lines and short games.  This has been one of my favorite gambits for the past year.  GM Larry Christiansen almost plays this gambit (he sacs the Bishop on c4 at f7) in many of his blitz games and doesn't have a problem winning.  But, then again, he is a grandmaster.

Good game by Shinkman, against Alonzo Wheeler Jerome himself -- handing White his head, only 3 months after the Jerome Gambit made its published debut! Note the value of a well-timed ...Qf6, as I mentioned in my response to PrawnEatsPrawn, above.
I guess the moral is:Don't play the Jerome Gambit -- or, if youdo, don't play it incorrespondence chess...
really really bad and unsound gambit
Noted.
No illusions here. Not too long agoChess Life for Kidsran my two-part article on "The Worst Chess Opening Ever" about the Jerome Gambit.
Although perhaps you might like the Jerome-style treatment of the Blackburne Shilling Gambit:1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nd4!? 4.Bxf7+!?. GM Lev Alburt's "Back to Basics" column in the March 2011 issue ofChess Lifefeatured a game of mine, with White, in this line.
