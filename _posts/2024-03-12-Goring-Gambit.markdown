TheGöring Attackis achess openingcharacterised by the moves:
The Göring Attack is a variation of theEvans Gambit(4.b4). After the Evans Gambit is accepted (4...Bxb4) and the riposte (5.c3) has prompted the defensive 5...Bc5 (the second most popular retreat), play continues until 10.Bg5, the defining move of the Göring Attack. It is named afterCarl Theodor Göring, who played it in several games againstJohannes Minckwitzin 1869. The Göring Attack came into fashion afterMikhail Chigorinplayed it againstWilhelm Steinitzin 1883. We are told Tchigorin scored his most brilliant successes with this variation.[1]Modern Chess Openingsdescribes it as a "tricky" opening, "which can be refuted only if you know the right moves".[2]
