TheGiuoco Pianois a popular chess opening from the beginner levels all the way up to grandmaster.Giuoco Pianotranslates from Italian into the "quiet game". First, let's take a look at the beginning moves that make up this opening.
TheGiuoco Pianois a great opening since it follows the three pillars of opening strategy.
1. Control the center- Starting with 1.e4 controls the center and opens up the diagonals for the bishop and the queen.
2. Develop pieces- White quickly develops the kingside pieces to their best squares.
3. Protect the king- On move four, White is ready to castle.
TheGiuoco Pianohas been around in written examples as early as the 16th century! It reached its maximum popularity in the 19th century under great players such as Steinitz, Morphy, and Anderssen. Here is a game by the first world champion Wilhelm Steinitz showing the power of this opening.

TheGiuoco Piano(Italianfor 'Quiet Game';pronounced[ˈdʒwɔːkoˈpjaːno])[1]is achess openingbeginning with the moves:
"White aims to develop quickly – but so does Black. White can construct apawn centrebut in unfavourable conditions a centre which cannot provide a basis for further active play."[3]
The name "Italian Game" is also commonly used;[4]however, that name is sometimes used instead to describe all openings starting 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4, including 3...Nf6 (theTwo Knights Defence) and other less common replies.
The Giuoco Piano is assigned codes C50 to C54 in theEncyclopaedia of Chess Openings.
The Giuoco Piano is one of the oldest recorded openings. The Portuguese writerPedro Damianoplayed it at the beginning of the 16th century and the ItalianGrecoplayed it at the beginning of the 17th century. The Giuoco Piano was popular through the 19th century, but modern refinements in defensive play have led most chess masters towards openings like theRuy Lopezthat offer White greater chances for long-terminitiative.
In modern play, grandmasters have shown distinct preference for the slower and more strategicGiuoco Pianissimo(4.d3, or 4.c3 Nf6 5.d3).Anatoly Karpovused the Giuoco Pianissimo againstViktor Korchnoitwice in the 1981 World Championship match, with both games ending in adraw;[5][6]Garry Kasparovused it againstJoël Lautierat Linares 1994, resigning after 29 moves;[7]Vladimir Kramnikchose it againstTeimour Radjabovat Linares (2004);[8]Viswanathan Anandused it to defeatJon Hammerin 2010;[9]Magnus Carlsenused it againstHikaru Nakamuraat London 2011, winning in 41 moves[10]andIan Nepomniachtchiused it against Magnus Carlsen in the 2021 World Championship match, losing in 49 moves.[11]
The main continuations on White's fourth move are:
Other continuations are:
White plays 4.c3 in preparation for the central advance d2–d4. The main reply 4...Nf6 was first analysed byGrecoin the 17th century. Alternatives include 4...Qe7, with the intention of holding on to the centre.
5.d4 exd4 6.cxd4
6...Bb4+
7.Nc3 Nxe4 8.0-0(diagram)
8...Bxc3! 9.d5
9...Bf6
10.Re1 Ne7 11.Rxe4 d6 12.Bg5 Bxg5 13.Nxg5 h6!
14.Bb5+
14...Bd7 15.Qe2 Bxb5 16.Qxb5+ Qd7 17.Qxb7
17...0-0 18.Rae1 Rab8 19.Qxa7 Nxd5 20.Qd4 Qf5 21.Nf3 Rb4
If White does not want togambitmaterial, 7.Bd2 is a good alternative. The game could continue 7...Bxd2+ (Kaufman recommends 7...Nxe4!?8.Bxb4 Nxb4 9.Bxf7+ Kxf7 10.Qb3+ d5!? [10...Kf8 11.Qxb4+ Qe7 12.Qxe7+ Kxe7 is safer, reaching an equalendgame] 11.Ne5+ Ke6! 12.Qxb4 c5!?) 8.Nbxd2 d5 9.exd5 Nxd5 10.Qb3 Nce7 (10...Na5 is an alternative, inviting a repetition of moves after 11.Qa4+ Nc6 [threatening 12...Nb6] 12.Qb3 Na5) 11.0-0 0-0 12.Rfe1 c6. In this position White has more freedom, but theisolated d-pawncan be a weakness. 7.Nbd2 is also a viable move for White, although this still only offers approximate equality. It has not been a popular choice among human players, but it seems to be recommended by computer engines.[18]7.Kf1?! has been largely abandoned.[19]
Black can try to hold astrongpointin the centre at e5 with 4...Qe7, a move which first appeared in theGöttingen manuscriptaround 1500.[20]After 5.d4 (5.0-0 usually transposes) Bb6,  White's options include 6.0-0, 6.d5, 6.a4 and 6.Bg5.[21]A typical continuation is 6.0-0 d6 7.a4 a6 8.h3 Nf6 9.Re1 0-0 (Leonhardt–Spielmann, Ostend 1907).[22]
4...Bb6 usually transposes after 5.d4 Qe7.
Other 4th moves for Black are considered inferior.
With 4.d3, White plays the Giuoco Pianissimo (Italian: "Very Quiet Game", a name given byAdolf Anderssen).[23]White aims for a slow buildup, deferring thepushto d4 until it can be prepared. By avoiding an immediate confrontation in the centre, White prevents the early release oftensionthrough exchanges and enters a positional maneuvering game. 4.Nc3 Nf6 5.d3 is the Giuoco Pianissimo Deferred.[24]4.d3 f5 is the not-so-quiet Lucchini Gambit; there can follow 5.Ng5 f4, theDuboisVariation.[25]
If White plays c2–c3, the position can take some characteristics of theRuy Lopezif the bishop retreats to c2 via b3. This idea has been taken up by some grandmasters, such asAnish Giri, to avoid the drawishBerlin Defencein the Ruy Lopez. White can also play b4 and a4, chasing the Black bishop and staking outspaceon thequeenside. Despite its slow,drawishreputation, this variation became more popular after being taken up byJohn Nunnin the 1980s. The common move orders are 4.c3 Nf6 5.d3 (ECOC54), and transposition from theBishop's Opening: 2.Bc4 Nf6 3.d3 Nc6 4.Nf3 Bc5 5.c3 or 5.0-0 d6 6.c3.
