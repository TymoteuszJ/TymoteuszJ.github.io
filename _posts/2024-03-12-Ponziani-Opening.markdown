ThePonziani Openingis achess openingthat begins with the moves:
It is one of the oldest chess openings, having been discussed in literature by 1497. It was advocated byHoward Staunton, generally considered the world's strongest player from 1843 to 1851, in his 1847 bookThe Chess-Player's Handbook. For some decades, it was often called "Staunton's Opening" or the "English Knight's Game" as a result. Today, it is usually known by the name ofDomenico Lorenzo Ponziani, whose main contribution to the opening was his introduction, in 1769, of thecountergambit3...f5!?
The opening is now considered inferior to 3.Bb5, theRuy Lopez, and 3.Bc4, theItalian Game, and is accordingly rarely seen today at any level of play. Magnus Carlsen used it for a victory in 2013.[1]Black's main responses are 3...Nf6, leading toquietplay, and 3...d5, leading tosharpplay. Ponziani's countergambit 3...f5!? was successfully played in thegrandmastergameHikaru Nakamura–Julio Becerra Rivero, US Championship 2007.[2]
The Ponziani is one of the oldest known openings, having been first discussed in chess literature by no later than 1497. It was mentioned in both of the earliest chess treatises: theRepetición de Amores y Arte de Ajedrez con ci Iuegos de PartidobyLucena[3]and theGöttingen manuscript.[4]Today the opening bears the surname ofDomenico Lorenzo Ponziani. Although Ponziani did analyze the opening in 1769, his principal contribution was the introduction of thecountergambit3...f5!?[5]Later the opening was favored byHoward Staunton, who inThe Chess-Player's Handbook(1847) called it "so full of interest and variety, that its omission in many of the leading works on the game is truly unaccountable. ... it deserves, and, if we mistake not, will yet attain a higher place in the category of legitimate openings than has hitherto been assigned to it."[5]
Staunton cumbersomely referred to the opening as "The Queen's Bishop's Pawn Game in the King's Knight's Opening",[5]as didGeorge H. D. GossipinThe Chess Player's Manual(1888, American edition 1902).[6]Napoleon Marache, one of the leading American players, similarly called it the "Queen's Bishop's Pawn Game" in his 1866 manual.[7]In their treatiseChess Openings Ancient and Modern(1889, 1896),E. Freeboroughand theReverend C.E. Rankencalled it "Staunton's Opening".[8][9]In an appendix to later editions of Staunton's work, R.F. Green, editor ofBritish Chess Magazine, also called it "Staunton's Opening", directing those seeking a definition of "Ponziani's Game" to the former name.[10]Green referred to 3...f5 as "Ponziani's Counter Gambit".[11]Chess historianH. J. R. Murrayin his celebrated 1913 workA History of Chesscalled the opening simply the "Staunton",[12]explaining that he was using "the ordinary names of the Openings as used by English players of the present day".[13]James Masonin his treatiseThe Art of Chess(Fourth Edition c. 1910?) referred to the opening as the "Ponziani–Staunton Attack".[14]The famous GermanHandbuch des Schachspiels, which went through eight editions between 1843 and 1916, called it the "Englisches Springerspiel" (English Knight's Game).[15]The Reverend E.E. Cunnington inThe Modern Chess Primer(Thirteenth Edition 1933) referred to it as the "Ponziani Opening (sometimes called Staunton's)".[16]
Wilhelm Steinitz, the firstWorld Champion, in his 1895 treatiseThe Modern Chess Instructor(Part II), called the opening the "Ponziani Opening",[17]as did his successor,Emanuel Lasker, inLasker's Manual of Chess.[18]Similarly,Frank MarshallinChess Openings,[19]the authors ofModern Chess Openings(Second Edition 1913),[20]andSiegbert TarraschinThe Game of Chess(1931, English translation 1938)[21]called it "Ponziani's Opening". William Cook inThe Chess Players' Compendium(Fifth Edition 1910) called it "Ponziani's Game",[22]whileFrancis Joseph Leeand Gossip inThe Complete Chess – Guide(1903) called it "Ponziani's Knight's Game".[23]Contemporary authors likewise call it the "Ponziani Opening",[24][25]"Ponziani's Opening",[26]or simply the "Ponziani".[27]
The Ponziani is rarely played today except as a surprise weapon, because Black has the pleasant choice betweenequalizingeasily and attempting to obtain an advantage with sharper play.[28]White's third move prepares to build a powerfulpawn centerwith 4.d4, a logical objective also seen in the more popularRuy LopezandGiuoco Piano. However, 3.c3 is somewhat premature because the move: 1) takes away the most natural square for White'squeen knight,[29]2) temporarily creates aholeon d3, and 3)developsa pawn rather than a piece, leaving White behind in development[30]and not well placed to meet a counterattack in thecenter. Moreover, unlike in the Giuoco Piano, where White's d4 advance attacks Black'sking bishopon c5, in the Ponziani d4 will not gain atempo. On the positive side, the move 3.c3 creates a second diagonal for the white queen.[30]
As early as 1904, Marshall wrote that, "There is no point in White's third move unless Black plays badly. ... White practically surrenders theprivilege of the first move."[31]More recently,Graham Burgesscalled the Ponziani "a relic from a bygone age, popular neither at top level nor at club level".[32]Bruce Pandolfinihas said,
Curiously, every great teacher of openings who investigated the Ponziani has concluded that it leads to interesting play and deserves to be played more often. Yet it has never captured the fancy of chessplayers in general, and it remains to be seen whether the Ponziani is an opening of the past or of the future.[33]
InChess Master vs. Chess Amateur,Max Euweand Walter Meiden wrote, "What should one do with this opening? It is no opening for beginners, because tactics predominate in the play. There are no simple strategic principles to govern the general lines in this opening."[30]
After 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.c3 the main continuations are:
Here is a quietdrawtypical of the 3...Nf6 line:
While this game was agreed drawn there are good winning chances for White in this type of endgame.[44]
The variation 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.c3 Nge7 has been attributed to Reti due to him having tried it against Tartakower and lost. Recent analysis gives White the edge, i.e. 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.c3 Nge7 4.Bc4 (immediately targeting f7) d5 5.exd5 Nxd5 and now either 6.0-0 or 6.Qb3 lead to a White advantage.[45]Also playable for White is 4.Bb5 whichtransposesto a line of theCozio Defense to the Ruy Lopez.[46]
Here are two games illustrating the wild tactical play that often develops in the 3...d5 4.Qa4 f6 5.Bb5 Ne7 line:
