## Falkbeer Counter-Gambit
# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Gambit,_Falkbeer_Countergambit)
TheFalkbeer Countergambitis achess openingthat begins:
In this aggressivecountergambit, Black disdains thepawnoffered as asacrifice, instead opening thecentreto exploit White's weakness on thekingside. After the standard capture, 3.exd5, Black may reply with 3...exf4,transposinginto theKing's Gambit Accepted, 3...e4, or the more modern 3...c6.
A well-known blunder in this opening is White's reply 3.fxe5??, which after 3...Qh4+, either losesmaterialafter 4.g3 Qxe4+,forkingthe king and rook, or severely exposes the white king to the black pieces after 4.Ke2 Qxe4+ 5.Kf2 Bc5+.
The opening bears the name of Austrian masterErnst Falkbeerwho played it in an 1851 game againstAdolf Anderssen.[1]TheEncyclopaedia of Chess Openingscodes for the Falkbeer Countergambit are C31 and C32.
In this variation, Black'scompensationfor the sacrificed pawn primarily consists of his lead indevelopment, coupled with the exposure of White's king. A typical line may run: 4.d3 Nf6 5.dxe4 Nxe4 6.Nf3 Bc5, where Black aims for the weakness on f2. InMaehrisch-Ostrau1923, a game betweenRudolf SpielmannandSiegbert Tarraschcontinued: 7.Qe2 Bf5 (this was condemned by theHandbuch des Schachspielsbecause of White's next, though Black had already gotten into difficulties in the gameRéti–Breyer, Budapest 1917, where 7...f5 8.Nfd2 Bf2+ 9.Kd1 Qxd5 10.Nc3 was played) 8.g4?!(in retrospect, prudent was 8.Nc3) 8...0-0!9.gxf5 Re8 and Black has a tremendous position, as he is bound to regain material and White's positional deficiencies will remain.[2]
This line fell out of favour afterWorld War II, as Black encountered difficulties, with players eventually turning to the next idea.
This has become the most commonly played move after 3.exd5, with its most notable advocate beingJohn Nunn. It is usually attributed toAron Nimzowitsch, who successfully played it inSpielmann–Nimzowitsch, Munich 1906.[3]Frank Marshallactually introduced the move to master play, however, at Ostend 1905, defeatingRichard Teichmannin 34 moves.[4][5]Annotating that game in his 1914 bookMarshall's Chess "Swindles", Marshall described his 3...c6 as "An innovation."[6]
Although Black won both of those games, 3...c6 languished in obscurity for many years thereafter. White can respond with 4.Qe2, despite the drastic defeat inflicted on the youngAlexander AlekhinebyPaul Johnerat Carlsbad 1911, although 4.Nc3 exf4 is much more common. The resulting positions are analogous to theModern Defence of the King's Gambit Accepted, in which White strives to utilise his 4–2queensidepawnmajority, with Black relying on his piece activity and cramping pawn at f4 to play against White's king.Theoryhas not reached a definitive verdict, but the resulting positions are believed to offer Black more chances than 3...e4.

Okay so basically the Falkbeer counter gambit goes 1. e4 e5 2. f4 d5 3. exd5 e4
Looks like maybe you should get a book on the KG. You won't get many good, in-depth answers from a chess.com forum.
And honestly, if you're studying this for use as black (which appears you are) I wouldn't spend to much time on it, not many people play the King's gambit. But what do I know, I play 1. ..c5. Do you see the KG a lot?
Never mind what the book line is. Just play the best you can from here. You already achieved your objective... to derail the KG. If you aren't playing mano a mano from here out and your opponent so prepared that he already has a fatal trap in mind then dealing with one extra move isn't going to help you.
4. Bb5+ is worth considering.
There is a line in the Falkbeer Counter Gambit in which black just pushes the e-pawn ( 3. ... e4 ) and is willing to sac it should white attack it with the d-pawn ( 4. d3 ) by pushing it even further ( 4. ... e3 ). I encountered this line in the demo version of some chess teaching program. Being two pawns down is not that great I thought to myself. But the Kings Gambit came up in a recent sudden death game of mine and I decided to give it a try. My opponent seemingly unfamiliar with the position chose to attack the pushed pawn with the knight instead. The result was shocking:

It may be that the Falkbeer Counter Gambit is objectively somewhat more favourable to white than some other defenses to the Kings Gambit but in a quick game it seems far more playable since black has a very comfortable development and not many issues that need long thinking ( not to mention the element of surprise ).
1.e4 e5 2.f4 d5 3.exd5 e4? loses.
3...c6 and 3...exf4 are only moves. 3...exf4 is better.

Seconded, except for the typo in "[m]any".
Interestingly the Falkbeer transposes to the Scandinavian Defense in some lines. So you might also like to look at the Scandinavian. It is always helpful not to just look at opening lines in books but to go through entire games from databases which show you how the masters handled the resulting middle and end games.
3... exf4 is the engine's top move. Why play 3... e4 ?
