In his Chessable courses, GMSam Shanklandsays that any opening named after an animal is bad. The Elephant Gambit may be "Dumbo" to a super grandmaster. However, as a surprise weapon, it can stampede a chess player caught unaware. Here are the key points you need to know about this popular Black opening:
The Elephant Gambit arises after the moves 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3d5!?What are the pros and cons from Black's perspective?
Of course, the only way to refute a gambit is to accept it.Â  After 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d5?!, the Elephant Gambit has three key variations:
The Paulsen Countergambit is named afterLouis Paulsen, a 19th-century master from Germany. After 3.exd5, Black plays 3...e4 to kick the king's knight from its defensive position and attack the kingside.
The Maroczy Gambit is named after GMGeza Maroczyfrom Hungary. After 3.exd5, Black plays 3...Bd6 to develop rapidly the kingside and protect the e5-pawn.
Another variation in the Elephant Gambit is when White plays 3.Nxe5 instead of 3.exd5.
In a casual game in 1863,Wilhelm Steinitz, the first world chess champion, fell victim to the Elephant Gambit. It may be a dubious opening, but if a world champion can lose to it so can you!
GMMikhail Tal, the eighth world chess champion, fared better than Steinitz. In the following game, Tal gave a masterclass on how to dismantle the Elephant Gambit.
If you enjoy the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the Elephant Gambit and find success with it in your games, there's nothing wrong with using it as part of your repertoire. However, if your goal is to improve your overall understanding of chess and develop a more solid foundation, you may want to explore other openings that have stood the test of time.
