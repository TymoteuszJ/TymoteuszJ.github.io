hello friends today i have one question for you are you tired playing passivly against e5 such as danish gambit,fried liver attack ,siciian defence or caro knan defence in which you give the center to white and then hit back.
after going through so many opening i found one which can help in the following ways-
1.secez center
2.aggresive opening
3.has many traps
4.white lost positinaly
5.a complete pakage against e4
so let's start .

so let's start by delcining the gambit steap by step.
dg-1

dg-1-a

in above game as you saw we enjoyed cheakmating the blacks king.
dg-1-b

dg-1-b-(i)-a
dg-1-b-(i)-b

dg-1-b-(ii)
dg-2
dg-3-1
dg-3-2

so that was all about declining the gambit let's see what happens if white accpets the gambit
eg-1
eg-1-(i)-a

eg-1-(i)-b

do everyone a favor and just stop with this non-sense.
wht are yu mad do not dare to post anything on my forum again its not for losers like you
The Colorado-Gambit is a really fascinating opening, too bad that there is at least one line, where only White has all the fun.
I wonder, why you are showing several lines, but not the critical one.
in the lines with Bb5 white is better in all variations.
1.secez center

lololol
wht are yu mad do not dare to post anything on my forum again its not for losers like you

No offense, but all you seem to comment about is how achintya is a bad player, and nothing else.  Try to focus on something else, please.

As for the Colorado Gambit, I personally think it's unsound, and the line that Dark_Falcon gave above is the way that White should probably go if he wants to gain an advantage.  It's a bit of a tricky variation to deal with if White is unprepared, but it's been getting a bit more attention recently (especially on this site), so I'm pretty sure relying on the pure surprise value won't cut it at all anymore.  Of course, no player who uses the Nimzowitsch wants to respond to 2.Nf3 with 2...e5, so it's perfectly reasonable to find a response that stays independent while also remaining playable.  However, I really don't see the Colorado Gambit as the answer, because it gives White a good amount of play without much compensation for Black.  There are definitely other lines that are equally creative and yet more sound (my personal favorite was 2...Nf6), but 2.Nf3 is definitely a problem for Black that is yet to be solved.
It's not that he's a bad player, it is just that he makes it look like "his" analysis is groundbreaking, while it is clearly missing critical lines, as shown by alot of players already. As for 2.Nf3, I like to transpose to some sort of weird pirc defense with a knight on c6.

go on above links to know more
about missing lines i am soon going to put them through games

Why do post several games with crap declined lines like 3.e5?! or even better 3.Nh4???
Its a Gambit, so you can only proof its soundness when you accept it.
And please comment the refutation line 3.exf5 d5 4.Bb5...
If you present an opening in a thread you have to reply on critical comments.
i will post refusation to some critical lines
Errr, he forgot to deal with 3.Ke2!
Can Black equalize after this?
No way, Mr. pfren. I think you found Colo's Achilles!
There are many poor, but difficult to face openings for weaker players.  IMO this isn't one of them.
yes, it can see the all links i have posted and you will get your answer
Errr, he forgot to deal with 3.Ke2!
Can Black equalize after this?
I always thought, you would prefer solid chess :D
But 3.Ke2 is clearly an error...cause its refuted by 3...Kf7!

The Colorado Gambit is an aggressive line in the Nimzowitsch Defence. Black looks to weaken his king side pawn structure in exchange for some deadly attacks against white. This is a solid opening for black but usually works best as a surprise opening against a player that hasn’t studied all of the lines.
1. e4 Nc62. Nf3 f5
White must play carefully as there are many traps and dangerous lines that black can play. Unlike other gambits, black would prefer that white not take the pawn on f5. Instead, black would like to control the center of the board with the f5 pawn and quickly development the rest of his pieces.
Many of the variations in this opening have safe lines and aggressive lines. If you choose to play the Colorado Gambit I recommend you go with the more aggressive lines. Because e4 is so common, you’ll have many opportunities to try out this opening.
Make sure you check out the video below to learn more about all the variations.
