## Bogo Indian Defense
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Bogo-Indian-Defense)
In theBogo-Indian Defense, named for GMEfim Bogoljubow, Black develops the kingside quickly. As with mosthypermodernopenings, the "Bogo" (as it is known informally) seeks to fight for central squares with pieces before occupying them with pawns.
The Bogo-Indian begins1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 Bb4+. Variations branch out depending on how White blocks the check.
4.Qd2?? is an embarrassing mouseslip, while 4.Nfd2?! moves an already-developed piece. That leaves three serious moves, one of which, 4.Nc3, transposes into a variation of theNimzo-Indian Defense.
There are a few variations based on the remaining two theoretically-independent moves, 4.Bd2 and 4.Nbd2.
White's most popular move offers a trade of dark-squared bishops. Black has several responses to this move. In order of popularity:
If White does not want to enter the Nimzo-Indian or to develop the bishop to d2,4.Nbd2is played. White usually follows up with 5.a3 to try and pick up the two bishops, where Black can either acquiesce or retreat.
Black has three main responses to 4.Nbd2.
The Bogo-Indian has always been somewhat of a sideline, with theQueen's Indian Defense(3...b6) being more popular as well as transposing into the Queen's Gambit Declined (3...d5). Although it has been played a few times inCandidatestournaments, it has never been seen in aworld championshipmatch.
Bogoljubow himself played it six times with Black, scoring only +1 -3 =2.

TheBogo-Indian Defenceis achess openingcharacterised by the moves:
The position after 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 is common. The traditional move for White here is 3.Nc3, threatening to set up a big pawn centre with 4.e4. However, 3.Nf3 is often played instead as a way of avoiding theNimzo-Indian Defence(which would follow after 3.Nc3 Bb4). After 3.Nf3, Black usually plays 3...b6 (theQueen's Indian Defence) or 3...d5 (transposing to theQueen's Gambit Declined), but can instead play 3...Bb4+, the Bogo-Indian Defence. Databases suggest that the Bogo-Indian is played approximately half as often as the Queen's Indian.
The Bogo-Indian Defence can also arise via the move order 1.d4 e6 2.c4 Bb4+, theKeres Defence.
The Bogo-Indian is classified as E11 by theEncyclopaedia of Chess Openings(ECO).
The Bogo-Indian Defence is named after the Russian-born German masterEfim Bogoljubowwho is believed to have originated the opening and played it regularly in the 1920s. Subsequent prominent players to have adopted the Bogo-Indian includeAron Nimzowitsch,Paul Keres,Tigran Petrosian,Bent Larsen,Vasily Smyslov,Viktor Korchnoi,Ulf Andersson,Michael AdamsandNikita Vitiugov.
White has three viable moves to meet thecheck. 4.Nc3 is atranspositionto theKasparov Variationof the Nimzo-Indian, therefore the main independent variations are 4.Bd2 and 4.Nbd2.
4.Bd2 is the most common line; the bishop on b4 is now threatened and Black must decide how to meet this threat.
4.Nbd2 is an alternative aiming to acquire thebishopfor theknightor forcing Black's bishop to retreat. The downside is that the knight is developed to a square where it blocks the bishop, and d2 is a less active square than c3. The line is described in theGambit Guideas "ambitious". Black's most common replies are 4...b6, 4...0-0, and 4...d5.
This opening can sometimes give rise to theMonticelli Trap.
