## Bishops Opening
# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop%27s_Opening)
TheBishop's Openingis achess openingthat begins with the moves:
White attacks Black's f7-square and prevents Black from advancing the d-pawn to d5. By ignoring the beginner's maxim "developknightsbeforebishops", White leaves their f-pawn unblocked, preserving the possibility of f2–f4.
The f2–f4pushgives the Bishop's Opening an affinity with theKing's Gambitand theVienna Game, two openings that share this characteristic. The Bishop's Opening cantransposeinto either of these openings, and in particular a favorable variation of the King's Gambit, but with care Black can circumvent this. Transpositions into theGiuoco Pianoand theTwo Knights Defenseand other openings are also possible.
TheEncyclopaedia of Chess Openingsassigns the Bishop's Opening the codes C23 and C24.
The Bishop's Opening is one of the oldest openings to be analyzed; it was studied byLucenaandRuy Lopez.  Later it was played byPhilidor.Larsenwas one of the fewgrandmastersto play it often, after first using it at the 1964Interzonaltournament.  Although the Bishop's Opening is uncommon today, it has been used occasionally as a surprise by players such asKasparov.Nunnuses it to avoidPetrov's Defence(1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6),[1]andLékóplayed it in the2007 World ChampionshipagainstKramnik, known to consistently play the Petrov.
Weaver Adamsin his classic workWhite to Play and Winclaimed that the Bishop's Opening was a win for White byforcefrom the second move.[2]He was unable to prove this by defeating players stronger than himself, however, and later abandoned the Bishop's Opening for theVienna Game, making the same claim.[3]GrandmasterNick de Firmian, in the 14th edition ofModern Chess Openings, concludes that the Bishop's Opening leads toequalitywith best play by both sides,[4]and notes that, "Among modern players onlyBent Larsenhas played it much, but even Kasparov gave it a whirl (winning against Bareev)."[5]
Because White's second move makes no direct threat, Black has many possible second-move responses. As shown below, the Bishop's Opening offers opportunities to transpose to several otherOpen Games.
Probably Black's most popular second move is 2...Nf6, forcing White to decide how to defend the e-pawn.

After 3.d3 Black must be careful not to drift into an inferior variation of theKing's Gambit Declined. One continuation that avoids this pitfall is 3...c6 4.Nf3 d5 5.Bb3 Bd6.
White sometimes chooses the Bishop's Opening move order to transpose into theGiuoco Pianowhile preventing Black from playingPetrov's Defense.  For example, 2...Nf6 3.d3 Nc6 4.Nf3 Bc5 reaches the quietGiuoco Pianissimo.
TheUrusov Gambitis named after Russian PrinceSergey Semyonovich Urusov(1827–1897). After 2...Nf6 3.d4 exd4 (3...Nxe4 4.dxe5 gives White some advantage) 4.Nf3, Black can transpose to theTwo Knights Defensewith 4...Nc6, or can decline the gambit with 4...d5 5.exd5 Bb4+ 6.c3 (6.Kf1 is recommended by Michael Goeller, winning a pawn at the expense of castling rights) 6...Qe7+ 7.Be2 dxc3, when 8.bxc3 and 8.Nxc3 both offer approximately equal chances.  Instead, Black can accept the gambit with 4...Nxe4 5.Qxd4 Nf6 (5...Nd6?6.0-0 gives White an overwhelming attack), and White will continue with Nc3, Bg5, Qh4, 0-0-0, and usually intends to meet ...0-0 and ...h6 with the piece sacrifice Bxh6, exposing the black king.  Black has a solid position with no clear weaknesses, but White has attacking chances and piece activity as compensation for the pawn. The Urusov Gambit is also occasionally reached via thePetrov Defenceafter 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.d4 exd4 4.Bc4.
TheBoden–Kieseritzky Gambitis named after English players and chess writersSamuel BodenandLionel Kieseritzky.  Boden published the first analysis of it in 1851. Opening theoreticians consider that after 2...Nf6 3.Nf3 Nxe4 4.Nc3 Nxc3 5.dxc3 f6, White's attack is not quite worth a pawn. The game may continue 6.0-0 Nc6 (not 6...Be7? 7.Nxe5! with a tremendous attack, but 6...d6 is alsoplayable) 7.Nh4 g6 8.f4 f5 9.Nf3 (9.Nxf5? d5!) e4 10.Ng5 (10.Ne5 Qe7! threatening Qc5+ is strong) Bc5+. In practice, Black's lack ofdevelopmentand inability tocastlekingsidecan prove very problematic.
Safer for Black arePaul Morphy's solid 5...c6 6.Nxe5 d5, returning the pawn with equality, and 4...Nc6!?(instead of 4...Nxc3) 5.0-0 (5.Nxe4 d5) Nxc3 6.dxc3 Qe7! when, according toBobby FischerinMy 60 Memorable Games, "White has no compensation for the pawn."[6]
Black can also decline the pawn with 3...Nc6, transposing into theTwo Knights Defense. He must, however, be willing to offer a gambit himself after 4.Ng5. White may invite an offshoot of the Boden–Kieseritzky Gambit with 4.0-0 Nxe4 5.Nc3.
Irregular move orders are 2.Nc3 (Vienna) Nf6 3.Bc4 Nxe4 4.Nf3 and 2.Nf3 Nf6 (Russian or Petrov Defence) 3.Bc4 Nxe4 4.Nc3.

The Classical Defense (also known as theBoi Variation[7]) is Black's symmetrical response, 2...Bc5.
White can then transpose into theVienna Game(3.Nc3) or theGiuoco Piano(3.Nf3 Nc6), or remain in the Bishop's Opening with the Wing Gambit (3.b4) or the Philidor Variation (3.c3). The main line of the Philidor Variation runs: 3.c3 Nf6 4.d4 exd4 5.e5 d5! 6.exf6 dxc4 7.Qh5 0-0 8.Qxc5 Re8+ 9.Ne2 d3 10.Be3. Transpositions into theKing's GambitDeclined and the Giuoco Piano are also possible after 3.d3.
TheWing Gambitresults in positions similar to those in theEvans Gambit. It can transpose into the Evans Gambit, for instance by 3.b4 Bxb4 4.c3 Ba5 5.Nf3 Nc6. It can also lead to the Four Pawns Gambit after 3... Bxb4 4. f4 exf4 5. Nf3 Be7 6. d4 Bh4+ 7. g3 fxg3 8. O-O gxh2+ 9. Kh1
Black's most energetic response to the Philidor Variation is the Lewis Countergambit, 3.c3 d5, named for the English player and authorWilliam Lewis(1787–1870) who published analysis of the line in 1834. Note that 4.exd4 is a mistake because of 4... Bxf2 5. Kxf2 Qh5+ 6. g6 Qxc5.
Among amateurs, 3.Qf3 and 3.Qh5 are also popular, threatening an immediateScholar's mate. But the threat is easily met (e.g. 3.Qh5 Qe7) and the moves are considered inferior since they hamper White's development or leave the queen exposed, leading to loss oftempo. As a well known attack, these moves are mostly blocked by Black, who can smash the whole strategy in one move, like Qe7 or Nh6.
Other Black second moves are rarely played. If Black tries to transpose into theHungarian Defensewith 2...Be7?, then 3.Qh5 wins a pawn.
The Calabrese Countergambit (2...f5?!) is named afterGreco's homeland,Calabria. It is considered dubious, as the line recommended byCarl Jaenisch, 3.d3 Nf6 4.f4 d6 5.Nf3, gives White the advantage. Other analyses, however, have found that the sharp 3.f4! or safe 3.Nc3 are better for White than 3.d3.

Today we will examine the favorite opening of most beginners- 1.e4 e5 2. Bc4 which is the Bishop's Opening.  Of course, most beginners play 2.Bc4 with the sole purpose of playing 3. Qh5 and then 4. Qxf7 checkmate. Pretty quickly we all learn that the Fool's mate doesn't happen too often when you play strong opponents, so we abandon the 3.Qh5 first and then in most of the cases the 2.Bc4 as well and switch to more sophisticated openings.  But 2.Bc4 is a perfectly good move. And even 3.Qh5 can be a good move in certain situation.  Just imagine these moves: 1e4 e5 2 Bc4 Be7?. Here 3. Qh5! is the best move which wins a pawn right away!  The most popular Black's response is 2...Nf6 where White has a choice.  The move 3.Nc3 leads to theVienna Game.  The solid 3.d3 leads in most of the cases to a slow positional struggle.  But what if we play 3.d4?  This move immediately creates some problems for our opponents to solve.  Let's examine Black's possible responses.
If Black captures the e4 pawn by 3...Nxe4 then after 4. dxe5 White creates a strong threat 5.Qd5, which wins a piece right away, due to the threat of checkmate on f7.  By the way, you can notice, that even though this is called the Bishop's Opening, in most of the variations the real star is the White Queen.  We'll see many variations where the Queen decides the game pretty quickly.
