## Grand Prix Attack
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/blog/RussBell/fighting-the-sicilian-with-the-grand-prix-attack)
TheGrand Prix Attack (1.e4 c5 2.Nc3 -or 2.f4)is an aggressive, yet sound, opening for White against the Sicilian Defense.  White intends to play the game on his/her terms, avoiding Black's intentions of playing the myriad, heavily theory-laden, so-calledOpen Sicilianvariations.  The Grand Prix Attack (GPA) typically features an early f4 by White, preparing a King-side attack.  This anti-Sicilian weapon is easier to learn compared to many other White responses to the Sicilian Defense, and is well suited for the fast time control games - bullet, blitz and rapid.
The following two gamesillustrate typical thematic attacking schemes for White in the GPA.Note especially the opening-up of attacking lines, typically on the Kingside, whenWhite employs all of his pieces in the attackand demolition of the Black King's defenses, so that the inevitable coup de grace may be delivered by the major pieces, Queen and rooks...
The following game illustrates the original, sharpBc4 variationof the GPA.Along with Mark Hebden, Julian Hodgson was a major contributor to the development of the theory of the GPA in the 1970's and 80's when they popularized the opening while successfully playing it on theEnglish Chess Federation Grand Prix chess circuitin the UK during that period...

The following game illustrates the so-called "modern", positionalBb5variationof the GPA.In fact, on p.149 of his book"Starting Out: Sicilian GPA"(see*below), Gawain Jones, a foremost authority on the GPA, states"3.Bb5 is the best scoring line for White in the Grand Prix Attack."...

Bookson Sicilian Grand Prix Attack
For those just starting out learning the Grand Prix Attackthe first two books below, by Vincent Moret and Gawain Jones, stand out...
My First Chess Opening Repertoire for Whiteby Vincent Moret...
Moret's book is a complete introductory opening repertoire for White based on 1.e4, covering Black's major replies.  In particular, for our purposes, his choice against the Sicilian Defense is the Grand Prix Attack.The presentation and instruction on the GPA are outstanding.Moret goes to lengths to explain, teach, the themes and plans for White, including not only WHAT to play, but also the detailed procedures for HOW to play against Black's typical responses.I highly recommend this as a first book for learning the GPA - the instruction on the GPA alone is easily worth the price of the book.See my review of the book (as 'RLBell")here.  The book is also available as a course onChessable.
*Starting Out: Sicilian Grand Prix Attackby Gawain Jones...
Thorough, very instructive coverage of the Grand Prix Attack, written by a foremost authority on the GPA.  IMO it is the best introductory, stand-alone book on this opening.This book is essential if you intend to play the GPA seriously, even if you also own Moret's book.Also available ineBook formatand inpdf format.
Some games from the book...
https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chesscollection?cid=1031445
Sicilian Grand Prix Attackby James Plaskett...
A good collection of instructive annotated GPA games.  Available inpdf format.
The Grand Prix Attack: Attacking Lines with f4 Against the Sicilianby Gary Lane...
Another good collection of annotated GPA games.  Available inpdf format.
The Grand Prix Attackby Evgeny Sveshnikov...
An interesting and relatively advanced book of deeply annotated GPA games.  Sveshnikov (after whom a well-known variation of the Sicilian Defense is named) is a recognized expert and long-time practitioner of the GPA, and a staunch proponent of the move 2.f4 (as opposed to 2.Nc3), the case for which he attempts to make via the majority of games featuring this move order in the book.

As White against 1.e4 e5 -The Vienna Game & Gambit !
If you enjoy playing theGrand Prix Attackas White against the Sicilian Defense (1.e4 c5),there is a good chance you might like playing theVienna Game & Gambitas White against 1.e4 e5.
For an aggressive yet sound White response to1.e4 e5I suggest to check out my blog article...
Introduction To The Vienna Game & Gambit...
https://www.chess.com/blog/RussBell/introduction-to-the-vienna-game-gambit
In particular you will notice thatWhite's first several moves in the Vienna Game & Gambit are the same as for the Grand Prix Attack(1.e4 / 2.Nc3, followed soon thereafter by f4).
While these openings are different by virtue of Black's first move, since White's first few moves are typically the same in both openings there is some commonality not only in the setup but also in the fact that for both openings White's intention is to launch a kingside attack, which is the point of the aggressive placement of the f4 pawn in both openings.
These similarities suggest that what one learns in terms of strategies and tactics from one opening may, in many situations, prove useful when playing the other opening as well.  The commonalities also imply that in terms of a 1.e4 opening repertoire for White it should be more productive and efficient to study these two openings than two totally dissimilar openings, with completely different pawn structures, strategies and tactics.It is for all these reasons that I chose to create the articles on these two openings.
