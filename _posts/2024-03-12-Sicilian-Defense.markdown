## Sicilian Defense
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Sicilian-Defense)
The Sicilian Defense is the most popular response to White's 1.e4. Employed by masters and beginners alike, the Sicilian Defense is a reputable and positionally sound opening. Still, the Sicilian is a combative opening that tends to lead to dynamic and sharp positions.
One of the oldest registered openings, the Sicilian is full of theory and was used by most of the greatest players in history. World champions GMsBobby Fischer,Garry Kasparov,Viswanathan Anand,Vladimir Kramnik, andMagnus Carlsenare just a few of its adopters.
TheSicilian Defensestarts after the moves1.e4 c5, when Black chooses to imbalance the position from the start. Black's reason behind 1...c5 is to fight for their share of the center (specifically, the d4-square) with a wing pawn.
Black intends to advance the d and e-pawns later to control critical squares. Frequently, White will put pressure on one side of the board while Black will fight for their dominance over the other side. This dynamic usually creates tactically rich games with more decisive results.
Being one of the oldest and most respected openings for Black, the Sicilian has an extensive amount of theory. There are numerous variations, each of them dissected thoroughly. Below you can see a list with a few of the main lines of the Sicilian Defense.
When faced with the Sicilian, White has the option of either opening or closing the position. The Closed Variation is not the most common but is also widely popular and was one of GMBoris Spassky's weapons of choice with White. It starts after the moves1.e4 c5 2.Nc3, when White signals they have no intention of immediately opening up the center. White will usually expand on the kingside in the main lines of this variation.
The Open Variation is the most common way for White to meet the Sicilian. It starts after the moves1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4or1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4. As the name suggests, this variation leads to more open and tactical games. White will gain space and immediately fight over control of the center, while Black will enjoy a semi-open c-file and active piece play.

The Najdorf Variation is one of the most popular lines in the Sicilian Defense and was frequently used by both Fischer and Kasparov. It starts after the moves1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6. Black's 5...a6 prepares counterplay on the queenside while maintaining flexibility. Heavily theoretical, this line usually leads to complex games with a wealth of tactical possibilities.
The Alapin Variation happens after the moves1.e4 c5 2.c3. White's 2.c3 prepares the d2-d4 pawn advance, with the downside that the c3-square will no longer be available for the knight. This line is excellent for players who want to avoid the massive amount of theory behind other variations.
The Dragon Variation occurs after1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 g6. Black fianchettoes their dark-squared bishop, attacking the center and the queenside. This variation is one of the most aggressive for Black. In its most critical lines, Black castles kingside and White castles queenside, with both players racing to checkmate first.
The French Variation of the Sicilian Defense starts after the moves1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6. Black opts for a more flexible setup, usually avoiding the more tactical lines of the Sicilian. After this, several other well-known variations like the Taimanov, Scheveningen, Four Knights, and Paulsen can arise.
The Sicilian Defense is one of the oldest known openings in chess. The Italian player Polerio mentioned the opening in 1594, which was also analyzed later by other Italian players. The match betweenLouis-Charles de La BourdonnaisandAlexander McDonnellfor the unofficial title of World Champion helped popularize the opening in 1834.
The opening started surging in popularity by the second half of the 20th century, with players like GMsAlexander Kotov,Bent Larsen,Mark Taimanov, andMikhail Taladopting the opening. Later, former world champions Fischer and Kasparov cemented the opening's reputation as one of the best fighting options against 1.e4.
