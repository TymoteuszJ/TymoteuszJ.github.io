## English Opening
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/English-Opening)
The English Opening is a flank opening where White advances their c-pawn two squares instead of the d- or e-pawns. The English is a highly transpositional opening, meaning that in many cases the game will reach the same position that arises from other openings and through different move orders. The English Opening is most suitable for intermediate and advanced players and demands more understanding of positional concepts.
A respectable opening, the English has been adopted by several elite players. Among them are former world champions GMsMikhail Botvinnik,Garry Kasparov, and even the 1.e4-devoteeBobby Fischer.
TheEnglish Openinghappens when White starts the game with the move1.c4. White refrains from moving their d and e-pawns and instead uses a flank pawn to control the center.
White's first move allows for more versatile play with the center pawns by both sides. The game mainly revolves around who will get to solidify their grip over the center of the board.
Usually, White will play with a Sicilian-like setup with colors reversed or the game will transpose into a queen's-pawn opening. The latter is another reason behind White's move: it avoids or limits Black's responses to some defenses against 1.d4 openings.
As mentioned, the English is a highly transpositional opening. For this reason, it has few independent variations. However, that doesn't mean that it is light in theory. Due to its positional nature and the many transpositions that can occur, White must know what they're doing to employ this opening successfully. Below you can see the main variations in the English Opening.
Reversed Sicilian games start after Black plays the move...e5, either after1.c4 e5or after delaying the e-pawn thrust for a few moves. As the name suggests, White will play a Sicilian-like setup with an extra tempo.

The Four Knights Variation happens after the moves1.c4 e5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.Nf3 Nc6. Black's setup is flexible and allows for counterattacks. They will usually exchange their dark-squared bishop for White's c3-knight or play against White's Sicilian Dragon setup down a tempo.
The Bremen System occurs after1.c4 e5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.g3. White accelerates the development of their light-squared bishop, trying to increase their control over the central light-squares. They can also use this variation to limit Black's options and later transpose to other lines of the Four Knights'.
The Botvinnik System is a development setup that White can adopt when playing the English. As a system, this development scheme works against many different moves Black chooses to play in the opening.
Its basic setup involves building a pawn triangle on the c4, d3, and e4-squares, controlling the d5 square, and tying up Black's pieces. White also places a knight on c3, fianchettoes a bishop on g2, and castles kingside. Move order is not as important in this system as long as White reaches the final setup.
The Botvinnik System is easy to learn but still has some sting. White can go for a kingside mating attack, playing in the center with a powerful knight on d5, or even play on the queenside. On the other hand, Black can get a good game if they can exploit the holes left by White's pawn play, especially in the d4-square.
The Closed Variation starts with the moves1.c4 e5 2.Nc3 Nc6when Black plays as White would play a Closed Sicilian. White usually dominates the queenside while Black gets counterplay on the kingside. The way players develop their kingside knight impacts the rest of the game significantly.
The Symmetrical English is the umbrella of openings that arise after1.c4 c5. From there, the game can transpose into numerous variations of the Sicilian Defense or other openings.
The Symmetrical, Four Knights' Variation starts after1.c4 c5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nc3 Nc6. In this variation, one of the players will usually push their d-pawn forward two squares, and players will battle for the control of the central squares.
The Ultra-Symmetrical line starts with the moves1.c4 c5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.g3 g6 4.Bg2 Bg7. Both players fianchetto their kingside bishop to discourage their opponents from pushing the d-pawn. This variation usually leads to slow, maneuvering games.
The Hedgehog Defense is a solid way for Black to deal with the English. It starts after the moves1.c4 c5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nc3 e6 4.g3 b6 5.Bg2 Bb7 6.O-O Be7, when Black accepts a cramped position to later counterattack at the right moment. Black usually exchanges their c-pawn for White's d-pawn, lines up a queen and rook on the semi-open c-file, and develops their pieces behind their pawns. Black's play revolves around making use of their pieces' dynamic potential.
The English Opening receives its name fromHoward Staunton, the famous English master. Staunton played1.c4six times againstPierre de Saint Amantin their unofficial world championship match. However, the opening didn't become popular until Botvinnik started using it in the 1930s.
The English hit its peak during the 1960s through the 1980s after elite players started using it regularly. Some of its adopters were GMsTigran Petrosian,Jan Timman, and Kasparov. Even Fischer, who almost always preferred 1.e4 openings, employed the English to win a game against GMBoris Spasskyduring their world championship match.
From the 1990s onward, the popularity of the English has slightly declined. However, the opening is still played frequently and is part of many world-class players' opening repertoire.

TheEnglish Openingis achess openingthat begins with the move:
Aflank opening, it is the fourth most popular[1][2]and, according to various databases, one of the four most successful of White's twenty possible first moves.[1][3]White begins the fight for thecentreby staking a claim to the d5-square from the wing, inhypermodernstyle. Although many lines of the English have a distinct character, the opening is often used as atranspositionaldevice in much the same way as 1.Nf3 – to avoid such highly regarded responses to 1.d4 as theNimzo-IndianandGrünfeldDefences – and is considered reliable and flexible.[4]
The English derives its name from the leading 19th century English masterHoward Staunton, who played it during his 1843 match withSaint-Amantand atLondon 1851, the first international tournament.[5]It did not inspire Staunton's contemporaries and caught on only in the twentieth century.[5]It is now recognised as asolidopening that may be used to reach both classical andhypermodern chesspositions.Mikhail Botvinnik,Tigran Petrosian,Anatoly Karpov,Garry Kasparov,Magnus Carlsen, andDing Lirenhave employed it during their world championship matches.Bobby Fischercreated a stir when he switched to it from his customary1.e4late in his career, employing it againstLev PolugaevskyandOscar Pannoat thePalma de MallorcaInterzonalin 1970, and inhis world championship matchagainstBoris Spassky.
Opening theoreticians who write on the English Opening divide it into three broad categories, generally determined by Black's choice of defensive setup.
The Symmetrical Defence[6](classified A30–39 inECO) is 1...c5, and is so named because both of the c-pawns are advanced two squares, maintaining symmetry. Note that Black can reach the Symmetrical Defence through many move orders by deferring ...c5, and often does. For example, 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 (or 2.Nf3) c5.
Either player may make an early break in the centre with the d-pawn.
Similar to theOpen Sicilian, an early d2–d4 for White can arise on the third move in the Symmetrical Defence with 2.Nf3, where Black has chosen one of 2...Nc6, 2...e6, 2...d6, or 2...g6.
After 3.d4, the game usually continues with 3...cxd4 4.Nxd4. The games can give a large variety of positional and tactical ideas, and can transpose into variants of the Open Sicilian involving theMaróczy Bind, such as theAccelerated Dragon, Taimanov, Kan, or Kalashnikov Variations, if White plays e4 in a later move. If Black manages to play d5 before White plays e4, then the game could transpose into variants of theQueen's Gambit Declined.
When Black plays 2...Nf6, these lines are often called the Anti-Benoni, since these positions are often reached after the transposition 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.Nf3, where White avoided theBenoni Defensethat would arise after 3.d5. After 3...cxd4 4.Nxd4, Black could follow up with 4...e5 forcing White's knight to go to the queenside and avoiding the transpositions to the Sicilian or the QGD; however, White could avoid the line by first playing 3.Nc3 and then play 4.d4, if Black doesn't play 3...d5 (see below). Same as above, the position could transpose into a Queen's Gambit Declined or an Open Sicilian involving the Maróczy Bind.
There are several types of positions that can arise from the Symmetrical Defence. Among the ideas are:[7]
The Reversed Sicilian (classified A20–29 inECO) is another broad category of defence, introduced by the response 1...e5. Note again, that Black can delay playing ...e5, for example 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.Nf3 e5 whereupon even though ...e5 has been delayed, once it is played the defence is classified as a Reversed Sicilian.
After 1...e5, White has Black's position in theSicilianbut with an extratempo. This is often called the ReversedSicilian,[9]though others call it the King's English.[10]Bruce Leverett, writing the English chapter inMCO-14, stated, "It is natural to treat the English as a Sicilian reversed, but the results are often surprising—main lines in the Sicilian Defence correspond to obscure side variations in the English, and vice versa."
The third broad category consists of the non-...e5 and non-...c5 responses, classified A10–19 inECO. Most often these defences consist of Nf6, e6, and d5 or Bb4 systemic responses by Black, or aSlav-like system consisting of c6 and d5, a directKing's Indian Defencesetup with Nf6, g6, Bg7, 0-0, after which c5 and e5 are eschewed, or 1...f5, which usually transposes to aDutch Defenceonce White plays d4. All irregular responses such as 1...b6 and 1...g5 are also lumped into this third broad category.
If White plays an early d4, the game will usually transpose into either theQueen's Gambitor anIndian Defence.
For example, after 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 g6 3.d4 d5 the game has transposed into theGrünfeld Defence, usually reached by the move order 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5.
White can, however, also play 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 g6 3.e4, making it impossible for Black to reach a Grünfeld, instead more or less forcing them into lines of theKing's Indian Defencewith 3...d6. Black also cannot force a Grünfeld with 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 d5, since White can deviate with 3.cxd5 Nxd5 4.g3, a line played several times byMikhail Botvinnikin 1958, in his final match for the world championship withVasily Smyslov.
Instead of playing an early d4, White can also play Nf3 andfianchettotheking's bishop(g3 and Bg2), transposing into a Réti Opening.
Also, after 1.c4 c6, White can transpose into thePolish Opening, Outflank Variation, by playing 2.b4!?, which can be used as a surprise weapon if Black does not know very much about the Polish Opening.[19]
The many different transpositional possibilities available to White make the English a slippery opening for Black to defend against, and make it necessary for them to consider carefully whatmove orderto employ. For instance, if Black would like to play aQueen's Gambit Declined(QGD), the most accurate move order to do so is 1...e6 2.d4 d5. (Of course, White can again play the Réti instead with 2.Nf3 d5 3.b3.) If Black plays instead 1...Nf6 2.Nc3 e6, White can avoid the QGD by playing 3.e4, theFlohr–Mikenas Attack.
TheEncyclopaedia of Chess Openingshas classified the English Opening under the codes A10 through A39:
The English Opening is used byProfessor Moriartyin the filmSherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadowsas he and Holmes discuss their competing plans over a game of chess.  Both Holmes and Moriarty eventually play the final movesblindfoldedby citing out the last moves indescriptive notation(rather thanalgebraic, as the former was contemporary in the late 19th century), ending in Holmes checkmating Moriarty, just asWatsonfoils Moriarty's plans.
1.c4 is also used inPawn SacrificebyBobby Fischerin the climacticgame sixof the1972 World Chess ChampionshipversusBoris Spassky.
