## Catalan Opening
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Catalan-Opening)
The Catalan Opening is a 1.d4 opening where White seeks to combine the kingside fianchetto with pawns on d4/c4. Instead of a direct kingside attack, White will aim for long-term positional pressure in the center and on Black's queenside. These positions can lead to small and nagging edges with very technical endgames.
The Catalan usually begins1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3but other move orders are possible, for example 1.d4 d5 2.c4e6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.g3. The main idea is White fianchettoing on the kingside after playing the standard queen pawn opening moves d4 and c4, while Black plays ...e6. If Black instead also fianchettoes the kingside bishop, it's aKing's Indian Defense.
There are three main ways for Black to meet the Catalan: playing ...dxc4 (Open Catalan), reinforcing the d5-pawn with ...c6 (Closed Catalan), or avoiding it altogether by delaying or avoiding ...d5, usually with an early ...c5 instead.
Black opens the diagonal for White's g2-bishop. In some cases, White can regain the pawn by playing Qa4+ and Qxc4 before Black castles, but sometimes not. White must be prepared to treat the opening as a positional gambit (like theBenkofor Black), trying to put pressure down the h1-a8 diagonal, as in this uncommon line that nonetheless appeared in the 2021 World Championship:
If the pawn is not kept, Black must find a way to fight on the diagonal, as in this line:
When Black does not play ...dxc4, and instead secures the d-pawn with ...c6, it is the Closed Catalan. The traditional line, which is still the most common, goes:
Black simply blunts the a8-h1 diagonal that White has hoped to gain an advantage by controlling. Like most games with a closed center, the opening often turns into a slow, maneuvering middlegame.
Using the 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3 move order as the baseline, the nomenclature of what is considered the Catalan is such that Black can avoid the opening with any number of moves early on. For example, 3...c5 will usually transpose into either theBenonior a variation of theEnglish Opening.Black's other alternative, 3...Bb4+, comes closer to aBogo-Indianthan a Catalan, especially given the typical development of White's g1-knight to f3 in either opening.Black is also under no obligation to play 2...e6, avoiding the Catalan before it even gets started; most notably, 2...g6 3.g3 would produce a variation of the King's Indian.
As advantageous as the Catalan can be for White, White must be prepared to face all of these alternatives. Otherwise, the game can steer into a direction more favorable for Black.
According toModern Chess Openings, the Catalan Opening gets its name from the 1929 Barcelona tournament where GMSavielly Tartakoweris supposed to have invented it. However, there are instances of it appearing as far back as 1909. The opening first appeared in a World Championship in 1937 and was played extensively in the 2006 and 2010 World Championships. After a decade-long hiatus, it reappeared in the2021 FIDE World Championship.

TheCatalan Openingis achess openingwhere White plays d4 and c4 andfianchettoesthe white bishop on g2. A common opening sequence is 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3, although various other openings cantransposeinto the Catalan. TheEncyclopaedia of Chess Openings(ECO) lists codes E01–E09 for lines with 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3 d5 4.Bg2; other lines are part of E00.
In the Catalan, White adopts a combination of theQueen's GambitandRéti Opening. White combines the space-gaining moves d4 and c4 with g3, preparing to fianchetto the king's bishop. This places pressure mainly on the queenside while hoping to keep the white king safe in the long-term. The c4-pawn can become vulnerable, however, and White might have tosacrificea pawn.
Black has two main approaches to play against the Catalan: in the Open Catalan Black plays ...dxc4 and can either try to hold on to the pawn with ...b5 or give it back for extra time to free their game. In the Closed Catalan, Black does not capture on c4; their game can be somewhatcrampedfor a while, but is quitesolid. Additionally, Black has ways to avoid the Catalan.
The Catalan has had proponents at the highest level in chess, withVladimir Kramnik,Viswanathan AnandandMagnus Carlsenall employing the opening in their World Chess Championship title games. A number of other grandmasters have successfully played the Catalan, includingFabiano Caruana,Daniil Dubov,Anish GiriandDing Liren.
The Catalan derives its name fromCatalonia, after tournament organisers at the 1929Barcelonatournament askedSavielly Tartakowerto create a new variation in homage to the area's chess history. It had been played a few times before Tartakower's usage in the tournament, however: for instance,Réti–Leonhardt, Berlin 1928 transposed into an Open Catalan. The opening cemented itself in the repertoire of leading players of the 1930s and 1940s, such as world championsJose Raul Capablanca,Alexander AlekhineandMikhail Botvinnik, as well as top grandmasters such asSalo Flohr,Paul KeresandSamuel Reshevsky.[1]
The Catalan came to prominence at the top level when bothGarry KasparovandViktor Korchnoiplayed it in their Candidates Semifinal match in London in 1983: five games of the eleven-game match featured the Catalan.
In 2004,Ruben Felgaerwon a tournament celebrating the 75th anniversary of Barcelona 1929 and the birth of the Catalan Opening, ahead ofGrandmasters(GMs) Viktor Korchnoi,Mihail Marin, Lluis Comas and Viktor Moskalenko andInternational MasterManel Granados. Each game in the tournament, which was also held in Barcelona, began with the moves 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.g3 Nf6.
With its use byVladimir Kramnik, the Catalan gained a good deal of attention by high-level GMs in the 2010s.  Kramnik played the opening three times in theWorld Chess Championship 2006. The Catalan was also played four times byViswanathan Anandin theWorld Chess Championship 2010; in both instances, the opponent wasVeselin Topalov, and in each instance, White scored two more points than Black.
Magnus Carlsenbegan to employ the Catalan as his main opening in the late 2010s, most notably using it in the second game of the2021 World Chess ChampionshipagainstIan Nepomniachtchi, and used it extensively at theTata Steel Chess Tournament 2022.
The Open Catalan, Classical Line (ECOcode E05) consists of the moves 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3 d5 4.Bg2 dxc4 5.Nf3 Be7. White sacrifices the pawn for a lead indevelopment. Without a black pawn on d5, White'skingsidebishop hinders Black'squeensidedevelopment. The Open Catalan line has been a favorite ofAnatoly KarpovandEfim Gelleras Black and ofOleg Romanishinas White. Usually, White will recover the pawn with Qc2 and then a4, Ne5, or Qa4+. In order to hold the pawn, Black will have to seriously weaken the queenside with ...a6 and ...b5.
