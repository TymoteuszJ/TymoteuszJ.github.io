TheFried Liver Attackholds the award for the coolest opening name in chess. This variation of the Two-Knights Defense involves a bold knight sacrifice which forces the black king to take a walk. This variation is also known as theFegatello Attack, an Italian term which means "dead as a piece of meat!"

The key position in the Fried Liver Attack.
Let's take a look at what moves bring about this opening:
It is easy to see from the above position that Black's king is walking on thin ice. Many brilliant games have been played in this variation. Let us take a look how Paul Morphy crushed his father Alonzo Morphy when he was only thirteen years old!

The great Paul Morphy.
This opening variation is still alive and kicking today at the amateur and grandmaster level. For the last game, we will look at a more recent example between two 2600-level players. Even though this game was played over 200 years after the Morphy game, you can see the dangerous attack crashing through for White. Note: The black player was one of Magnus Carlsen's first coaches!
TheFried Liver Attackis a fun way to go after the king with a knight sacrifice if Black boldly takes the pawn on d5.

TheFried Liver Attackis one of the variations of theItalian Game, a 1.e4 opening. It's an aggressive opening in which White sacrifices a knight to gain the initiative and lure the black king to the middle of the board. It's uncommon to see the Fried Liver played by masters, and at the top level, Black avoids this line. However, it's an important line of the Italian Game and a must-know variation for those who play it (or against it).
The Fried Liver starts after the moves1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.Ng5 d5 5.exd5 Nxd5 6.Nxf7. White sacrifices a knight, with no viable way for Black to decline it.
After Black captures the knight with the king, White's idea is to bring the queen out with 7.Qf3+. With this move, White checks the enemy king and adds another attacker to the black d5-knight, forcing the Black's king to go to e6 to defend the piece.
There is only one viable (and rather counterintuitive) line for Black to play the Fried Liver; all the other options lose instantly. Below you can see Black's correct continuation and a few of the other most common and losing lines.
Black's only way to survive the Fried Liver is with the line1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.Ng5 d5 5.exd5 Nxd5 6.Nxf7 Kxf7 7.Qf3+ Ke6. Black moves the king toward the center of the board because it's the only way to save the d5-knight.
After this, Black's only plan is to consolidate their position—a task that computers can pull off but proves to be very difficult for humans.
Many club players who don't know theory play1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.Ng5 d5 5.exd5 Nxd5 6.Nxf7 Kxf7 7.Qf3+ Qf6. Black blocks the check and offers a queen trade, which would benefit them since they are currently a piece up. However, White can simply regain the piece with 8.Bxd5+ and gain a winning position with an extra pawn and a safer king.
Another common mistake Black can make is playing1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.Ng5 d5 5.exd5 Nxd5 6.Nxf7 Kxf7 7.Qf3+ Ke8. Black gives the piece back and retreats the king to a seemingly safer place. However, the extra pawn and a much better position give White a winning advantage.
Another mistake for Black is taking the line1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.Ng5 d5 5.exd5 Nxd5 6.Nxf7 Kxf7 7.Qf3+ Kg8. Surprisingly, this is the fourth most common move among club players, even though it leads to checkmate.
The Fried Liver variation of the Italian Game is one of the oldest openings in chess, with records dating back to the 1600s. In fact, one of the most famous games with this opening happened in 1610 between Giulio Cesare Polerio and Domenico.
Many theories try to explain why this variation is called the "Fried Liver." Some sources indicate that Italians called this opening the "fegatello," which literally translates to "little liver." However, there is no clear explanation of how that expression came to refer to this opening.
