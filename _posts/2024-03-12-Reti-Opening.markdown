## Reti Opening
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Reti-Opening)
1.Nf3 develops a piece instead of moving a pawn to begin the game. The knight develops to a good square that controls the center while keeping flexible options with the central pawns. A later d2-d4 move may transpose to a 1.d4 opening (while avoiding certain lines), while a later c2-c4 move might transpose to theEnglish Opening.
The Reti Opening can be used to refer to two different starting positions:
On Chess.com, 1.Nf3 is considered the Reti and 1.Nf3 d5 2.c4 is considered the Reti Gambit.
Because of its flexibility, the Reti Opening often transposes into something else, but there are some independent lines.
The Reti Gambit begins1.Nf3 d5 2.c4. Taking with2...dxc4is generally not recommended for Black, as it weakens Black's central control and (despite the variation's name as a "gambit") White can easily regain the pawn anyway, for example with3.Na3and4.Nxc4. Instead, Black usually reinforces the central pawn with either2...c6or2...e6, both of which are sometimes considered transpositions into the English Opening.
2...d4is also popular, gaining space but opening up the h1-a8 diagonal for White's kingside fianchetto; overall it is Black's most successful reply. After3.g3, Black can either reinforce the pawn with3...c5or play3...Nc6with the idea of4.Bg2 e5.
The other independently important variation after 1.Nf3 is theKing's Indian Attack(KIA). White quickly develops the kingside with g3, Bg2, and castles. Meanwhile Black's most common approach is to try to blunt the fianchettoed bishop's diagonal with ...d5 and ...c6.

1.Nf3 is often simply used, however, as a flexible first move that can turn into any number of other openings. Examples of how easily the Reti can transpose include:
The Reti Opening, named forRichard Reti, is a product of thehypermodern schoolthat became popular in the 20th century. That is suggested in its name, as Reti was one of the leading proponents of hypermodernism.
For most of chess history,1.e4was by far the most popular opening move. Late in the 19th century,1.d4became very popular as well.
The hypermodernists, however, preferred to control the center indirectly instead of occupying it with a pawn on move one. By starting the game with 1.Nf3, White develops a piece but remains flexible in how to approach the game overall.
In 1924, Reti used 1.Nf3 to win a game againstJose Raul Capablanca, ending the classical-style superstar's eight-year, 63-game winning streak. That game, more than any other, helped the hypermodern school and the move 1.Nf3 to become widely accepted.
In the same tournament Reti also won a famous brilliancy against Efim Bogoljubov with 1.Nf3 d5 2.c4.

TheRéti Openingis a hypermodernchess openingwhose "traditional" or "classic method" begins with the moves:[1]
White attacks Black's pawn from theflank, which may occasion 2...dxc4. White may couple this plan with akingsidefianchetto(g3 and Bg2) to create pressure on the light squares in thecenter.
The opening is named afterCzechoslovakianchess playerRichard Réti(1889–1929). The opening is in the spirit of the hypermodernism movement that Réti championed, with the center being dominated from the wings rather than by direct occupation. If White fianchettoes both bishops, castles kingside, and refrains from occupying the center with pawns, the result may be described as theRéti System.[1]
In theEncyclopaedia of Chess Openings, Réti Opening is classified as codes A04–A09, where it is closely associated with theKing's Indian Attack.[2]
According to Réti, the opening was introduced into master play in the early part of 1923.[3]Réti used the opening most famously to defeatJosé Raúl Capablanca, the reigningWorld Chess Champion, in a game at the1924 New York tournament.[4]Alexander Alekhineplayed the Réti in the 1920s, but at that time almost any game that began with Nf3 and c4 by White was considered to be the Réti. Réti popularized these moves against all defenses in the spirit ofhypermodernism, and as the opening developed it gained structure and a clearer distinction between it and other openings.
Hans Kmochcalled the system of attack employed by Réti in the game Réti–Rubinstein, Carlsbad 1923,[5]"the Réti Opening" or "the Réti System".Savielly Tartakowercalled the opening the "Réti–Zukertort Opening", and said of 1.Nf3: "An opening of the past, which became, towards 1923, the opening of the future."[6]
In modern times the Réti refers only to the configuration Nf3 and c4 by White with ...d5 by Black, where Whitefianchettosat least one bishop and does not play an early d4.[7]
After 2.c4 (ECOcode A09), Black's choices are:
If Black takes the pawn, then in the same manner as theQGA, 3.e3 or 3.e4 regains the pawn with a slight advantage to White, as Black is left somewhat undeveloped. 3.Na3 and 3.Qa4+ are also good, and commonly played. This variety of White options limits the popularity of 2...dxc4. Trying to protect the pawn with 3...b5?!allows 4.a4!leaving White with a superior position. The alternatives 2...d4, 2...c6, and 2...e6 are more common, with the latter two generally leading to aQueen's Gambittype of position, and 2...d4 typically being answered with 3.e3 or the interesting 3.b4!?
