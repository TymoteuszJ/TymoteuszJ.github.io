Spice Up the Four Knights with the Belgrade Gambit!
Looking for a way to spice up the open games?Simon Williams, the Ginger GM, takes the quiet Four Knights opening and spices it up with a gambit, featuring a lot of his original analysis. Take the game out of theory and into awhirlwind attack as quickly as possible.
Here is what you will learn:
"My favorite GM to listen to so far. Simon is easy to understand, simple, and clear and he explains WHY each move is good. He gives advice and a review. GREAT VIDEO!!!"- Chess.com member WATERZZ
"Oh no!!  As a die-hard 1...e5 player, this line was one of the few lines that scared me.  I always brushed it off thinking to myself, "I don't have to worry about it, because no one knows about this move."  Now I'm worried again.  Great video!  Now I have to come up with something for it in case it's played against me."- Chess.com member Gartholomew
