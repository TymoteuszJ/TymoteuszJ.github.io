## Four Knights Game
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Four-Knights-Game)
The Four Knights is a double king pawn opening in which both players develop their knights to ideal squares, pointed towards the center. Formerly considered a bit of a dinosaur, this opening has become somewhat popular again recently; it can lead to either sharp attacks or closed, maneuvering struggles.

TheFour Knights Gameis achess openingthat begins with the moves:
This is the most common sequence, but theknightsmaydevelopin any order to reach the same position.
The opening is fairly popular with beginners who strictly adhere to the opening principle: "Develop knights beforebishops." It was one of the workhorses in the family of theOpen Game, at even the highest levels, until World War I. Thereafter it fell by the wayside, along with a number of other Open Games. In this period ambitious players explored theRuy Lopez, believing it a better attempt byWhiteto exploit theadvantage of the first move. In the 1990s, this opening saw a renaissance, and is now seen in thepraxisof players from beginner tograndmaster.
The Four Knights usually leads to quietpositional play, though there are somesharpvariations. TheEncyclopaedia of Chess Openingshas three codes for the Four Knights Game:
White's most common move is 4.Bb5, theSpanish Variation. This variation can also be reached from theRuy Lopez, Berlin Defence. After 4.Bb5,Blackhas four major alternatives.
If White plays 4.d4, theScotch Four Knights Gamearises. This leads to a moreopen position, which can also be reached from theScotch Game, e.g. 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3. This variation was played in thefifth gameof the 1996Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparovmatch.
One reason White may choose the Four Knights (3.Nc3) move order over the Scotch (3.d4), besides fearing that after 3.d4 exd4 4.Nxd4 Black may choose 4...Bc5 or 4...Qh4, is that White may want to play the Belgrade Gambit (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.d4 exd4 5.Nd5!?). It is not possible to reach the Belgrade from the Scotch; however, the Belgrade is a distant second in popularity to 5.Nxd4.
A further possibility is 4.Bc4, theItalian Four Knights Game, or Prussian Four Knights Game, popular in the 1880s, though this line is regarded as inferior according to Pinski, and an outright mistake byIMLarry D. Evans.[3]Black can preserve the symmetry by 4...Bc5, leading to the quietGiuoco Pianissimo. A better move order for White that leads to this position is via theGiuoco Pianoby 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.Nc3 Nf6. The line is a favourite among younger players due to its simple and easy development, but was also used successfully byNigel ShortagainstAntoaneta Stefanova.[4]
The problem with playing for this position via the Four Knights Game is that after 4.Bc4, Black can perform the center fork trick by pseudo-sacrificinga knight with 4...Nxe4!. Then 5.Bxf7+?, though superficially attractive, relinquishes the bishop pair and central control to Black. After 5...Kxf7 6.Nxe4 d5 7.Neg5+ Kg8, Black is already threatening 8...e4, and after 8.d3 h6 9.Nh3 Bg4, Black has a very powerful position, with an unopposed light-squared bishop, a strong duo of pawns in the centre, and a safe king, while White needs to work out how to get the displaced knight on h3 into play; often it will need to be played back to g1.
Rather than 5.Bxf7+?, a better chance for White to play forequalityis 5.Nxe4, even though 5...d5 regains the piece with a good game, e.g., 6.Bd3 (6.Bxd5? Qxd5 7.Nc3 Qd8Estrin; 6.Bb5?!dxe4 7.Nxe5 Qg5!Collijn'sLärobok; 6.d4 dxc4 7.d5 Ne7 8.Nc3 c6 Cordel–Schupli, 1905) 6...dxe4 (the recently discovered 6...Nb4 is also playable) 7.Bxe4 Bd6 8.d4 Nxd4 9.Nxd4 exd4 10.Qxd4 0-0 11.Be3 (11.0-0??Bxh2+ wins) Qe7 (Tartakower–Atkins, London 1922[5]) and now the natural 12.0-0 Be5 would be awkward for White.[6]In the above line, more ambitious is 8...exd4 9.Nxd4 0-0!?, as in a match game betweenSiegbert TarraschandEmanuel Laskerin 1916, which led to a Black win in 23 moves.[7]
Another try is 5.0-0!?transposingto a variation of theBoden–Kieseritzky Gambit.
Igor Glekhas favoured 4.g3, preparing development of the bishop to g2. According to Pinski, Black's main responses are 4...Bc5 and 4...d5, both of which are reckoned to equalize for Black. A Halloween Gambit style 4...Nxe4 has also been tried at the grandmaster level as in two games betweenIlya SmirinandBartłomiej Macieja.[8]
Though rarely seen, this move is playable. For example, if Black plays 4...Bb4, White has the responses 5.Nd5, 5.0-0, and 5.d3, which retain equality with accurate play.
The quietwaiting move4.a3, theGunsberg Variation, is a specialty of PolishgrandmasterPaweł Blehm.
A dubiousgambitis 4.Nxe5?!, the so-calledHalloween Gambit. After 4...Nxe5 5.d4, White tries to seize the centre with his pawns and drive the black knights back to their home squares. GrandmasterLarry Kaufmansays that this line is refuted by 5...Nc6 6.d5 Bb4! 7.dxc6 Nxe4 8.Qd4 Qe7, which he attributes to Jan Pinski.[9]According toMax Euwe's opening series volume 11, Black has a decisive advantage after 5...Ng6 6.e5 Ng8 7.Bc4 d5 8.Bxd5 c6.[10]
