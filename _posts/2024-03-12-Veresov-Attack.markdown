## Veresov Attack
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Richter-Veresov-Attack)
The Veresov Attack is not the typical 1.d4-opening. White goes for fast development and often the players castle on opposite sides of the board. White's play revolves around the e4-square - often he tries to push through e2-e4.

TheRichter–Veresov Attack(orVeresov Opening) is achess openingthat begins with the moves:
It is also often reached by transposition, for example 1.d4 Nf6 2.Nc3 d5 3.Bg5 (the most common move order), 1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5 d5 3.Nc3, or 1.Nc3 Nf6 2.d4 d5 3.Bg5.
The opening was named after the GermanInternational MasterKurt Richterand later the Soviet masterGavriil Veresov, who played it frequently for over a quarter of a century.
Along with theTrompowsky Attack,Colle System,London System, andTorre Attack, the Richter–Veresov Attack is one of the more common branches of theQueen's Pawn Game. The Richter–Veresov Attack looks like the more popularRuy Lopezopening mirrored on thequeenside, but the dynamics of play are quite different.
TheEncyclopaedia of Chess Openingscode for the Richter–Veresov Attack is D01.
The opening dates back as far as the gameMarshall–Wolf, Monte Carlo 1902. However, it wasSavielly Tartakowerwho played it regularly in the 1920s and even to the end of his life, using it in his victory overDonnerat Staunton Centenary 1951. Tartakower's interpretation and treatment of the opening generally led to a closed, manoeuvring game.
Kurt Richter was the next player to develop new ideas in the opening, during the 1930s. He mostly found it useful to facilitate his risk-taking style, and he produced some dazzling victories which contributed to a whole chapter of his book of best games. Some theoreticians refer to the opening as the Richter Attack.
It was Gavriil Veresov, however, who greatly strengthened both the theory and practice of the opening from World War II to his heyday in the 1950s and 1960s. He is credited with demonstrating that the opening contained more subtlety and depth than was previously considered, often culminating in a central advance or direct assault on the enemy king. As a tool for rapid piece development, it resembled aking pawnopening, and required fewer pawn moves than standardqueen pawnfare.
The opening has never been very popular at the top level, though various prominent players have employed it on occasion. In 1959, for example,David Bronsteinplayed the Richter Attack against Veresov himself.[1]
Moving into the last third of the 20th century, grandmasters of the calibre ofSpassky,Tal,Smyslov,Larsen, and Bronstein all experimented with the Veresov Opening as an occasional surprise weapon. EvenKarpovemployed it with success againstRomanishinin a Soviet Team Championship. Other, more frequent practitioners have includedHéctor Rossetto,Lev Alburt,Victor Ciocaltea,Nikola Padevsky, andTony Miles.
In more contemporary play, the system has remained popular. GrandmasterJonny Hectorhas become an adherent of the Veresov and some interest has also been shown by leading GMAlexander Morozevich.
After 3.Bg5 (diagram), Black's most popular choices are 3...Nbd7, 3...e6, 3...Bf5, 3...c6, and 3...c5, all potentially leading to different variations. White's plans typically include rapid queenside castling and an early f3 and e4.
After the Black reply 3...Bf5, Richter usually continued 4.f3, intending to build a largepawn centre; Veresov, on the other hand, usually played 4.Bxf6, damaging the black pawn structure. Today, these two lines are known, respectively, as the Richter Variation[2]and Veresov Variation.[3]
