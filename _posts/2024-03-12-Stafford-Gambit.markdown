## Stafford Gambit
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/blog/ThummimS/stafford-gambit-traps-a-complete-guide)
1. Introduction
The Stafford Gambit is an objectively dubious, but highly venomous opening. A variationof Petrov's Defense, Black sacrifices a pawn on the third move for a quick attack. But is it a sound gambit? Should White accept the gambit to gain an advantage? Or should they decline it?
The Stafford Gambit certainly isn't an objectively good opening.
However, it's a tricky opening, and can be a weapon for Black in blitz and bullet games if White is not familiar with the gambit. Although it can give yousome fun wins, it's not an opening that you should consider playing in classical games though, especiallynot in longer time controls when your opponents have more time to think things through.


From this position, there are so many traps unsuspecting players can stumble into from the white side.
Black sacrifices a pawn and gives up all center pawns. In return, black hopes to get initiative and an attack on the kingside.
Black will often play Bc5, followed up by Ng4 to put pressure on the f2 pawn. Later, the move Qh4 with even more pressure on the f2 and h2 pawns is a common idea.
White will try to consolidate. Often played ideas for white are c3, followed by d4, to cut the bishop on c5 off from the diagonal.
White will often delay casting in order to defend against blacks immediate attacking ideas first.
2. Oh no my queen!

3. Oh no my knight!

4. Take my knight, but I'll take your rook!

6. Punishing natural development


8. Drag white's king to e4 (before move 10)


9. Everyone falls for this trap


10. Miscellaneous Lines


11. Refutation
With the high amount of traps that black could play, it's easy to fall into one if you are unprepared and under time pressure as the white player.
How can white refute the Stafford Gambit?
It should come to no surprise that the Stafford Gambit isn't a rock-solid opening — white can refute it and get away with an advantage.
The first move that you have to play in order to refute the Stafford is 5. d3, to protect the e4 pawn. After 5. … Bc5, you should play 6. Be2 to defend against Ng4.


Now the most testing move for black is 6. … h5.
A side variation is 6. … Ng4, with the idea of ​​playing Qh4 to fork the bishop on g4 and the f2 pawn.


But after 7. Bxg4 Qh4 8. g3 Qxg4 9. Qxg4 Bxg4 white is a comfortable pawn up.


It may appear that black has compensation because of the bishop pair and a development advantage, but the strong center pawns actually mean that black has nothing for the pawn.
Let's get back to the main move 6. … h5. The idea is clear — black wants to play Ng4.


Here, white has to play the key move 7. c3!


This strong move stops all of black's ideas. Ng4 is no longer dangerous because of d4. Black has to be prophylactic here and play 7. … Bb6.


This stops d4 because the pawn on e4 hangs otherwise. Now 8. Nd2 protects the e4 pawn and prepares d4.


A possible continuation could be 8. … Ng4 9. d4 c5 10. h3.


This position is pretty bad for black, he's a pawn down and white dominates positionally because he controls the center. Black will still try to play for tricks and I suggest that you analyze these lines for yourself as well.

**********

To conclude, though it may not be possible to cover every single line in the Stafford Gambit, through this comprehensive guide hopefully now you should have a better idea of ​​​​what Black must achieve and what White must avoid in this highly venomous opening.

The Stafford Gambit is a dangerous but objectively dubious variation ofPetrov's Defensein which Black sacrifices a pawn for a quick attack. Although not good in longer time controls when your opponents have more time to think things through, it is a tricky opening and can be a weapon for Black inblitzandbulletgames if White is not familiar with the gambit.
The Stafford Gambit goes1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nxe5and, instead of the usual 3...d6,3...Nc6. The main point is after4.Nxc6 dxc6(but not 4...bxc6?) Black can develop very quickly and aggressively.
White can actually avoid the gambit altogether with3.Bc4or3.Nc3, or decline it with4.Nf3or4.d4on the next move. Although not objectively best, these are safe choices for a player who has rarely or never faced the Stafford before.
Because the Stafford is so rare at high levels, not much traditional theory has developed around the gambit. Thus, instead of variations, there are some common traps Black can set against an unsuspecting opponent, and how White can avoid them.
One of the most common dead-lost lines for White was also the one played when the Stafford was introduced in 1950 (reasonably enough by a player, whose first name was not recorded, with the surname Stafford):
Black can also use the Stafford to trap White into an early forced checkmate—White is objectively lost in the previous line, but can try to play on in blitz or bullet. This one is important to know and somewhat reminiscent ofLegal's Mate, but with Black winning:
The main danger of facing the Stafford is that White can't just get away with natural moves. Notably, White shouldnotbe in a rush to castle kingside, as that is often a blunder that falls right into Black's attack, even before Black is fully developed.
The line that best demonstrates these truths is this one:
Despite all of Black's tricks, White can in fact keep the pawn and stay out of trouble in the opening.
Perhaps the easiest and safest way is the following:
It's not possible to cover every single line in the Stafford, but you should hopefully now have a better idea of what Black wants to achieve and what White wants to avoid in this opening.
The Stafford Gambit is named for the correspondence player who won a game in six moves in 1950 with the opening, using one of the above traps. In modern times, the gambit was popularized by streamer IMEric Rosen. In this video with Rosen playing on Chess.com, he demonstrates many more points of the Stafford:
