## Grob Attack
# Content [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grob%27s_Attack)
Grob's Attackis an unconventionalchess openingin which White begins with the move:
Although it has acult following, it is widely considered to be one of the worst possible first moves for White.International Master(IM)John Watsonwrites, "As far as I can tell, 1 g4 is competitive with 1 h4 for the honour of being White's worst first move. Against an informed or skilled opponent, it is simply masochistic."[1]
The opening takes its name from Swiss IMHenri Grob(1904–1974) who analysed it extensively and played hundreds ofcorrespondence gameswith it. In Grob's newspaper column analysis of this opening, he referred to it as theSpike Opening, a name which is still used occasionally. Other early references used the nameAhlhausen's Opening, after Carl Ahlhausen (1835–1892) ofBerlin, one of the first to play 1.g4.Savielly Tartakowersometimes played this opening insimultaneous exhibitionsand called it theGenoaorSan Pier D'Arena Opening, after the city and suburb ofGenoawhere he first used it.  In theCzech RepublicandSlovakia, 1.g4 is calledFric's Opening,[citation needed]and in other parts of the world it is calledKolibri's Opening.
Along with several other uncommon first moves for White, the Grob is classified under the code A00 ("irregular openings" or "uncommon openings") in theEncyclopedia of Chess Openings. White has three main plans: to support the g4 pawn with h3; pressure against d5 or on the h1–a8 diagonal, preventing Black from playing ...Bxg4 (e.g. 1.g4 d5 2.Bg2 Bxg4 3.c4, exploiting the pin against the b7-pawn); or advancing the h-pawn in akingsideattack.[2]
Perhaps the highest-profile game to feature the Grob was whenMichael Basmandefeated grandmaster and renowned theoristJohn Nunnwith it in 1978.[3]The Grob was also forced uponAnatoly Karpovby former Soviet premierMikhail Gorbachevin a friendly match againstSusan PolgarinLindsborg, Kansas2005. Gorbachev made the ceremonial first move and played 1.g4. Normally players can simply retract ceremonial moves they do not like. In this case Gorbachev insisted Karpov play on, saying he wanted to "cause some difficulties for the older player."[4][5]
The Grob was included in the opening book for the superfinal of the 12thTop Chess Engine Championshipseason (April–July 2018). Both finalists,StockfishandKomodo, evaluated the position after 1.g4 as providing a clear advantage for Black, and both failed to defend the White position.[6]
IMMichael BasmanandGrandmasterSpyridon Skembrisare advocates of the opening. It has a certain surprise value, and the average player is unlikely to know how to refute it and more likely to get overconfident and make mistakes. Moreover, the lack of theory along this line may negate the repertoire of an experienced opponent. Intuitive play by  Black can lead into dangerous traps.  Many of these traps rely on Black's replying with 1...d5, attacking the pawn with hisqueen's bishop. White can sacrifice the pawn with 2.Bg2 Bxg4 3.c4 with Qb3 to follow, giving White some pressure against the weakened squares d5 and b7.

Black is not obliged to give White these opportunities. In response to Grob's Attack, Black may also play 1...e5. Good responses would be 2.Bg2 (dominating the light-squared centre diagonal) or 2.c4, the English Variation, preparing Nc3 to solidify White's control of d5. After 1...e5, Black can take aim at the h4-square, left weak by White's pawn advance.  2.Bg2 h5 will force a weakening of White's pawn structure. 2.d3 (intending to answer 2...h5 with 3.g5) or 2.h3 can be answered by 2...Ne7 with the threat of ...Ng6 followed by ...Nf4 or ...Nh4, disrupting White's kingsidefianchetto.[7]
Another frequently used setup for White in the Grob is 1.g4, 2.h3, and 3.Bg2. A Black counter-setup might be 1...d5, 2...e5, and 3...c6 (these moves may be played in any order), which, if used in conjunction with an eventual ...e4, negates White'sking bishop's influence over the centre.
A key element of the Grob is deploying the king's bishop on g2 and having itrule the diagonal. In order to further this goal, White must keep the centre clear of pawns. This leads to frequent "tearing at the centre" with c4 often being White's third move.
Due to the unusual pawn structure White attains by playing g4 and c4 so early in the game, there is frequently little advantage tocastling. Play often devolves into a wild and wide-open game, with a definitive advantage usually resolving itself in the first 20 moves.
Black responding to any opening move by White with 1...g5 is called the "Borg Defence",[8]Borg being the reverse spelling of Grob. If played specifically in response to 1.e4, it is also called the Basman Defence, after Michael Basman.
