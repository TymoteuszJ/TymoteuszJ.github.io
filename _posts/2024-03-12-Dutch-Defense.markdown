## Dutch Defense
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Dutch-Defense)
The Dutch Defense might look like a reverse version of the Sicilian (1.e4 c5) - since both moves use a wing-pawn to mechanically prevent the creation of the 'perfect pawn center' by White. But due to the king positions, the Dutch is very different. 1...f5 gains space on the kingside at the expense of some weaknesses.
TheDutch Defensetraditionally begins1.d4 f5. Black sometimes plays1...e6followed by2...f5in order to avoid the Staunton Gambit.
The course of a typical Dutch Defense game is largely defined by Black's pawn structure. Afianchettoon the kingside with a pawn on d6 is the Leningrad; the c6-d5-e6-f5 structure is the Stonewall; and d6-e6-f5 is the hallmark of the Classical Dutch.
There are also a couple of important sidelines by White to know.
The Leningrad Variation is characterized by Black fianchettoing the dark-squared bishop and playing ...d6 to develop the light-squared bishop. The key position can be reached by several move orders, most commonly 1.d4 f52.g3 Nf6 3.Bg2 g6 4.Nf3 Bg7 5.O-O O-O 6.c4 d6. White often plays d5 at some point to control the hole created on e6 when Black plays both ...d6 and ...f5.
Even though the Leningrad is more common, perhaps no variation is more associated with the Dutch than the Stonewall, where Black tries to lock down the e4 square to occupy it with a knight and spearhead a kingside attack.
Once again several move orders are possible, for example 1.d4 f5 2.g3 Nf6 3.Bg2e6 4.c4 d5 5.Nf3 c6.
The most classic example of a Stonewall where Black plays the knight to e4 and wins on the kingside was this game fromSavielly TartakoweragainstGeza Maroczyin 1922. (Both players earned thetitleofgrandmasterwhen it was officially introduced in 1950.)
When Black neither fianchettoes on the kingside nor plays ...c6 and ...d5 it is considered the classical line, usually beginning with the move order 1.d4 f5 2.g3 Nf6 3.Nf3 e6 4.c4Be7(instead of 4...d5).
The Hopton Attack is simply2.Bg5on move two, with White's idea being to eliminate Black's knight when it moves to f6, so that it can't later jump to e4 as in the Stonewall.
This variation is also important because it introduces the possibility of a trap that every Dutch Defense player should know: 1.d4 f5 2.Bg5 h6 3.Bh4 g5 4.Bg3 f4 5.e3 fxg3?? 6.Qh5#. Black can easily avoid the trap by not trying to win the bishop, which is a plan that is doomed to fail, and focusing on development instead. The trap is still a good example of how 1...f5 is a somewhat weakening move.
The Staunton Gambit,2.e4, used to be thought to lead to a very strong attack for White, to the point where Black started to play1...e6and2...f5to avoid it.
Even though the gambit doesn't score well for White anymore, Black might still want to avoid it; the main idea of the Dutch is to attack the kingside, and so Black can get uncomfortable when White tries to do so instead.
However, in the 1...e6 move order Black must be prepared for 2.e4 anyway, when the game has transposed into theFrench Defense.
Unlike several openings, the Dutch doesn't have a clear philosophical origin or a period of exceptional popularity. For centuries now it's been a somewhat offbeat but ever-present way for Black to meet 1.d4.
Paul Morphy often played it on those rare occasions he faced a 1.d4 opening. Of the official world champions GM Mikhail Botvinnik is best known for employing it.
The heyday for the opening was probably the 1920s, when Tartakower won the game above andAlexander Alekhine(in 1922) and GMMiguel Najdorf(1929) also scored famous Dutch Defense victories.

TheDutch Defenceis achess openingcharacterised by the moves:
Black's 1...f5 stakes a claim to the e4-square and envisions an attack in themiddlegameon White'skingside; however, it also weakens Black's kingside to an extent (especially the e8–h5 diagonal).[1]Like its 1.e4 counterpart, theSicilian Defence, the Dutch is an aggressive and unbalancing opening, resulting in the lowest percentage of draws among the most common replies to 1.d4.[2]Historically, White has tried many methods to exploit the kingside weaknesses, such as theStaunton Gambit(2.e4) and Korchnoi Attack (2.h3 and 3.g4).
The Dutch has never been a main line against 1.d4 and is rarely seen today in high-level competition, although a number of top players, includingAlexander Alekhine,Bent Larsen,Paul Morphy,Miguel Najdorf, andHikaru Nakamura[3]have used it with success. Its most notable use may have been in 1951, when bothworld championMikhail Botvinnikand his challenger,David Bronstein, played it in their1951 World Championship match.
Elias Stein(1748–1812), anAlsatianwho settled inThe Hague, recommended the defence as the best reply to 1.d4 in his 1789 bookNouvel essai sur le Jeu des échecs, avec des réflexions militaires relatives à ce jeu.[4]
Siegbert Tarraschrejected the opening as unsound in his 1931 workThe Game of Chess, arguing that White should reply with theStaunton Gambit, with White being better after 2.e4 fxe4 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 c6 5.f3!exf3.[5]
White most oftenfianchettoesthe king's bishop with g3 and Bg2. Black also sometimes fianchettoes the king's bishop with ...g6 and ...Bg7 (theLeningrad Dutch), but may instead develop the bishop to e7, d6 (after ...d5), or b4 (the latter is most often seen if White plays c4 before castling). Play often runs 2.g3 Nf6 3.Bg2 e6 4.Nf3 (4.Nh3!?is also possible, intending Nf4–d3 to control the e5-square  Black plays theStonewall Variation) 4...Be7 5.0-0 0-0 6.c4 and now Black chooses between 6...d5 (the characteristic move of the Stonewall), 6...d6, theIlyin-Zhenevsky Variation(less popular today), or Alekhine's move 6...Ne4!? retaining the option of moving the d-pawn either one or two squares.
The opening's attacking potential is shown in thePolish Immortal, in whichMiguel Najdorf, using the Stonewall Variation, sacrificed all of hisminor piecesto win bycheckmate.
The Stonewall Dutch enjoyed a resurgence of interest in the 1980s and 1990s, when leadinggrandmasters(GMs)Artur Yusupov,Sergey Dolmatov,Nigel ShortandSimen Agdesteinhelped develop the system where Black plays an earlier ...d5 and places his dark-squared bishop on d6.[6]Termed theModern Stonewall, this setup has remained more popular than the traditional early ...Be7.
Magnus Carlsenhas used the Stonewall to score wins againstViswanathan Anand[7]andFabiano Caruana.[8]
Simon Williamsis one of the leading practitioners of the classical Dutch[citation needed]and wrote more than one book on the opening.[9]
The traditional move order involves White playing 2.c4. More commonly, White will start with 2.g3. Some common variations are: c4 is played after g3 and Bg2; c4 is played after Nf3; and c4 is played after 0-0.
Examples:
White has various more aggressive alternatives to the standard moves, including
Black sometimes starts with the move order 1...e6 to avoid these lines, although Black must then be ready to play theFrench Defenceif White continues 2.e4, rendering the Dutch no longer an option. The Staunton Gambit remains a good choice of opening for White in blitz tournaments where Black has little time to ponder the most accurate defense.
TheEncyclopaedia of Chess Openings(ECO) has twenty codes for the Dutch Defence, A80 through A99.
