## London System
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/London-System)
The London System is a popular 1.d4 opening for White which has the reputation of being very solid. The London is considered a system because White can play the same basic setup for almost all of Black's responses. For this reason, the theory on the London is not as extensive as it is for other openings.
White enters theLondon Systemwhen playing Bf4 before pushing a pawn to e3, usually through1.d4 d5 2.Bf4. Note that the old mainline was 1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Bf4, but the current theory states that playing2.Bf4instead of2.Nf3is slightly more accurate.
This opening's main idea is to create a solid pawn structure in the center by pushing pawns to c3 and e3, but only after developing the dark-squared bishop outside the pawn chain. Despite its being a solid opening by nature, the London also features aggressive lines and can catch Black off guard.
One of the advantages of the London System is that White will almost always play the same setup. Below are a few of the most common paths a London game can take:
The London's mainline leads to a balanced position where White will usually go for an attack on the kingside. On the other hand, Black will play for a central break or a counter-attack on the queenside:
1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Nf6 3. e3 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nd2 e6 6. Ngf3 Bd6 7. Bg3 O-O 8. Bd3 b6 9. Qe2 Bb7.
One of the most common responses from Black to the London System is to play an Indian Setup, fianchettoeing the dark-squared bishop. Black puts a pawn on g6 to discourage White from developing the light-squared bishop to the active d3-square.
White's most popular moves against this setup are almost identical to the mainline, except for the light-squared bishop developing to e2 instead of d3.
1.d4 Nf6 2.Bf4 g6 3.Nf3 Bg7 4.e3 d6

A setup that has been gaining popularity over the past years is the Jobava London. White develops the b-knight to c3, where they would usually put a pawn, to give it a more active square. The Jobava London can turn into a much sharper game, and White can get a significant advantage if Black plays incorrectly.
1.d4 Nf6 2.Nc3 d5 3.Bf4

If Black is familiar with how to face London System, there is not much White can do to create a significant advantage out of the opening. The mainline is an excellent way to equalize the game and create a balanced position. However, Black can try more testing lines that will force the White player to get out of their "comfort zone," notably:
Black scores well in this line, winning 49% of the games, drawing 23%, and losing only 22%. The idea is to bring the queen out to the queenside with 3...Qb6, where White's dark-square bishop can't help. Black puts pressure on the b-pawn and the center, later fianchettoing their dark-squared bishop on g7.
1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 c5
Note that a well-prepared London player will know this line and should be able to fight against it by deviating slightly from the usual white setup. White's best response is3.d5, which is not within the realm of the London System. As Black, you should be ready to play this line.
Another good try for Black is to go with the Indian setup with ...d6. Out of more than 2,000 games in our database, Black won 38%, drew 31%, and lost 31%. This line's main moves usually involve a slow and equal game, where Black will develop both their bishops in fianchetto. White will try to expand on the kingside and Black on the queenside.
1.d4 Nf6 2.Bf4 g6 3.Nf3 Bg7 4.e3 d6.
As with the other line, the prepared White player will know that deviating from the London moves is their best chance to gain an advantage. Once more, White can get out of the London System and play3.Nc3to get an edge, so you need to prepare for this.
Developing the dark-squared bishop to f4 and outside the pawn chain is a natural idea that has been played for centuries. However, this opening gained popularity at the top level after the 1922 London Congress, especially after the match between GMsAlexander AlekhineandMax Euwe.
More recently, the opening gained popularity after world championMagnus Carlsenadopted it as part of his repertoire.
The London System has been widely played by top players throughout the ages. Carlsen and GMGata Kamskyare more recent examples of players who employed it with great success in their careers.
Below we can see a game between Kamsky and GMSam Shankland. Kamsky employed one of the London's main ideas, creating a quick and deadly attack on the kingside. The game illustrates some tactical aspects of the opening.
The second game features Carlsen in his 2020 rapid game against GMDing Liren. Carlsen introduced a novelty with 7.Bxd6, sacrificing a pawn for a positional advantage that proved to be too much for the Chinese supergrandmaster to handle.
You now know what the London System is, how to reach it, and a few ways to counter it. If you want to learn more about this opening, check out ourMasters Databaseand study the games of the world's best players.

TheLondon Systemis anopening systeminchesswhere White opens with1.d4and develops thedark-squared bishopto f4, then supports the d4-pawn with pawns on e3 and c3. The other bishop is developed to d3 (or occasionally e2) and the knights typically to f3 and d2. This set-up often results in aclosed game. The London System can be used against virtually any Black defence and thus comprises a smaller body ofopening theorythan many other openings. Although it has a reputation as asolidopening, the London System has faced criticism for its tedious nature and lack ofdynamic play.[1][2][3][4][5][6]
The rapiddevelopmentof the dark-squared bishop in the London System can be contrasted with theColle System, in which thequeen's bishoptypically remains on c1 during the opening phase of the game.[7]
The British-AmericanJames Masonwas the firstmaster-level player to regularly employ the London System, including at the strong 1882 Vienna Tournament (in which he finished third) and later at tournaments at London (1883) and New York (1889). The opening did not catch on, and received limited outings in master play in subsequent decades. It did, however, appear with some regularity in the games of certain masters, includingF.J. Lee,Joseph Henry BlackburneandAkiba Rubinstein.
The nameLondon Systemderives from the reappearance of the opening on seven occasions in the very strong London tournament of 1922, including in games byJosé Raúl Capablanca,Alexander Alekhineand Akiba Rubinstein. After this tournament the opening remained rare in master practice, but the London set-up soon became the standard response forBlackagainst theRéti Opening(this line being named the New York Variation, after its use inRéti–Capablanca during theNew York 1924 tournament.
Although the London System remains rare ingrandmastertournaments, it has been played occasionally by players includingBent Larsen,Tony Miles,Teimour Radjabov,Vladimir KramnikandFabiano Caruana, and more frequently by players such asGata Kamsky,Levon AronianandMagnus Carlsen. During the 21st century the London System has become popular amongst club-level players due to its solid nature, clear plans and lack of aggressive responses by Black. One of the most famous games of the 21st century utilizing the London System wasround 6of the 2023 World Chess Championship betweenDing LirenandIan Nepomniachtchi.
The London System consists of a set-up for White employing the following moves (which can be played in a variety ofmove orders): d4, Nf3, Bf4, e3, Bd3, Nbd2, c3. The move h3 is often also played, enabling the bishop on f4 to drop back to h2 if attacked, thus remaining on the same diagonal and continuing to influence e5.
Following the publication of the influential 2005 workWin with the London Systemby Sverre Johnsen andVlatko Kovačević, it has become common for White to prefer to develop the queen's bishop to f4 on move 2 (rather than opting for 2.Nf3 and then 3.Bf4, as had previously been common). Johnsen and Kovačević note that, in the case of 2.Nf3, if play proceeds 2...c5 3.Bf4?!, then 3...cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nd7 "may already be better for Black".[8]Meanwhile,Kiril Georgievnotes inFighting the London Systemthat "The idea of delaying the [Nf3] development is to avoid the famous line [1.d4 d5] 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Bf4 c5 4.e3 Nc6 5.c3 Qb6 6.Qb3 c4 7.Qc2 Bf5, when White should retreat [the queen] ingloriously to c1."[9]
White's future plans will depend upon Black's choice of set-up. Black has a particularly wide range of possibilities in the early stages as White's London structure exerts little influence on Black's side of the board. Black may therefore develop freely. Common options include:
A popular response to the London System at higher levels of play is an early ...c5, allowing ...Qb6 (aiming at White's weak b2-pawn, which is no longer defended by a bishop on c1). This seeks to disrupt White's comfortable development system. The line 1.d4 Nf6 2.Bf4 c5 3.e3 Qb6 was considered by Johnsen and Kovačević to be the most critical line.[10]
A modern development named after grandmastersRichárd RapportandBaadur Jobava, this system still has considerable surprise value. It combines Bf4 with Nc3 (this knight would usually be developed to d2 in the standard London System) creating potential threats against Black's c7.
