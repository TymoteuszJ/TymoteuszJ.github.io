## Three-Pawn Gambit
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/forum/view/chess-openings/sacrafice-3-pawns-to-open)
I saw a post on a great opener (not here).
It was sacraficing 3 pawns right off the bat.The aftereffects where devistating for the person that gained the 3 pawns.
I'm a newbi, but I can't find that opening. I want to learn it.
Can someone tell me what that is?Thanks much
Hum... How to say that...
There are many ways to sacrifice three pawns in the beginning. And none leads to a playable game, as far as I know.
the top is 3 pawns the bottom 2 pawns sacrificed, both highly playable
Maybe at the OP's level, but not at mine. (This being said without contempt, I know I would have a bit of work against these, but still I am pretty sure I would score way better than against standard stuff).
shall i correct myself: both highly playable at all levels including GM level
Huh... No ?
If you find one GM game in the database for each, I would be impresssed.
I believe it's something like ...e4,e5,d4,pxp,pc3,pxp.bc4  ?   Fischer vs forget the last name...    initials--A.B
i don't have premium and am not especially good at extracting games from the database but put in the moves i gave and you'll see there are games. the first is called something like the 4 pawn gambit i think and is really hard to defend against if you're silly enough to take all the pawns the second is scotch goring double gambit (basically danish with Nf3 and Nc6 inserted which makes it much more sound and has a 66% win for white in the database of 36 games if accepted (although only a 53% win for white overall of 410 games as most decline the second pawn), i can't provide stats for the first gambit as i'm not premium, that sound ok mr irontiger????
No.
I asked from a GM database, not on a master's game database where you find 1.Na3 scoring 90% (in chess.com database, yes) because it is played by Kramnik vs. a random CM at the first round of tournaments to save his novelty for the last three rounds.
I want one single game featuring good players ofapproximate equal strengthfrom any database you like (not chess.com's if you don't want it).
This second one is called the Danish Gambit. Wikipedia says it's bad, but I know 1800's that play it with success.

There's a link to an article about it in chess.com
I am sorry but I have no desire to lose my time either, and the knowledge these openings are already crappy at my level, let alone in professional play.
If you consider it refusing the debate, let it be so. Come back after growing up, and tell me more about these wonderful openings.
Danish Gambit aceptad... No Nf3
e4 e5
d4 exd4
c3 dxc3
Bc4 cxb2
Bxb2...
growing up? why are people obsessed with this idea, i've been perfectly mature even if i'm incorrect which i may well be. please take your insults elsewhere.
LOL good answer
I m thinking than Nf3 maybe...when I lose :)
....go for Black Q and than Black come for white Q... If.... Wont that variation! Black have a good game. Just my opinion. Good luck finding agressiv moves or you know knowlege!

the latest match i found was the one between pavel dimitrov (white, 2321 rating) and ante brkic (black, 2581 rating). The game ended with a win by white.
ToOran_perrett, thank you. The 2nd game was what I was looking for.
Sorry - I said 3 pawns. It was 2. If I had remembered correctly, I could have found it. One reason I'm not good at chess -- I can't remember things. :-)
Yea cause I was thinking that you meant 2 because I know nothing about a three pawn sacrifice opening or ever heard about one.

Ok, I'm impressed.
Not by the result (Black declined the gambit probably out of fear of some home prep, so it's a bit easier to play as White, so that doesn't settle the matter), but by the fact someone actually played it (probably the 1-pawn way, but anyways).
OK. I'm not completely insane. The danish gambit, if I understand it correctly does sacrifice 3 pawns IF the opponent chooses to take the 3rd. The 3rd would be foolish on his part, but there is the potential for 3 pawn sacrifice.
Anyway, thank you for the answers. I'll get better, and hope to play some of you sometime soon.

That is one of the most famous games of morphy, not completety sound, and very old, but worthy of praise. There is not many games recent in the 3 pawn sack line.
No.
You are rude.If you not gonna answer his question then just not comment at all.

I've only gotten to use this gambit twice, but I really enjoy it and would recommend it to anyone looking to spice up a probably-already-spicy king's gambit repetoire.
I like that variation for white.
Wow black really wanted to lose that game
Just take the Knight and brazen it out on h8, it'll all be fine!!  Even better just take it on move 16 or 17!
Here'sa small study/history of the Cunningham, including the Wild Cunningham or 3 pawn gambit.
