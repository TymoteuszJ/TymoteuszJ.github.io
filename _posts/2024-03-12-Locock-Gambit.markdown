## Locock Gambit
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/forum/view/chess-openings/locock-gambit)

Maybe it worked during the days of Morphy.
After Black accepts the gambit with 5. ... Kxf7 White can play a very nice 6. dxe5 threatening to win the Knight back with interest because Black's Queen is left hanging.
I'm not sure what the book move is, but 6. ... Qe7 looks okay off the top of my head. This pretty much forces White to trade Queens, and material is even. Black's King is left in the center, but White doesn't look like he has enough punch to generate a decent attack. The resulting position looks drawish, even at the club level.
I cannot find this opening on any opening databases.Â  Only wikipedia.

The Locock Gambit is a very aggressive line in the Philidor Defense and starts with the moves:
1.e4 e52.Nf3 d63.d4 Nf64.Ng5 h65.Nxf7
The Philidor Defense is generally pretty passive. When you start out with e5 and d6 you are playing for a very long game by building up a strong pawn structure. This can be very frustrating for many players starting out with e4 because they are looking for an aggressive start.
With the Locock Gambit, white is able to regain the initiative and play a very aggressive line. The knight is sacrificed and in exchange, white is able to launch a strong attack against black
