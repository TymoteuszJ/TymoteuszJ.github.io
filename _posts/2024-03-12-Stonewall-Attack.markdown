## Stonewall Attack
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/blog/RussBell/stonewall-attack)
TheStonewall Attackis a Queen's pawn (1.d4) opening for White, which, in the hands of one who understands its relatively straightforward attacking plans and strategies, can be a lethal weapon.
While the opening is not currently in fashion, and isn't typically seen at the very highest levels, the Stonewall Attack is nevertheless very playable at the amateur and club level as most opponents at these levels will be less familiar with how to best defend against it.
The first five chapters of the book,"How to Think Ahead In Chess"by I.A. Horowitz and Fred Reinfeldare devoted to an introductory tutorial on the Stonewall Attack. The book is an "oldie but goodie" (1951), written in the older descriptive notation.  It focuses primarily on the themes, plans and strategies of the opening and is targeted to the beginner through intermediate amateur player.
The more recent"The Stonewall Attack"by Andrew Soltis(revised 2nd edition -1993, in algebraic notation) is an excellent introduction to the opening.  It was, and still is, the best introductory book on the Stonewall Attack, for every player.  I highly recommend it.  Unfortunately the book is out of print, but is available on Scribd.com as a download (under the 'Documents' menu only - search 'The Stonewall Attack Soltis')...

Stonewall Attack vs The London System
The Stonewall Attack may be viewed as a precursor toThe London Systemin the sense that the basic Kingside attacking motif of the main line Stonewall Attack can be discerned as having similarities to the main line London System (albeit in a modified form, due to the Stonewall's pawn on f4 and undeveloped dark-square Bishop).  In fact, the straight-forward attacking scheme of the Stonewall is easier to learn as there is far less opening "theory' (i.e., documented lines and variations) to deal with.  Together these two factors suggest that learning and playing the Stonewall first could be an effective avenue, or stepping stone (pun intended), for learning the London System.  In fact, particularly at the amateur level and in speed chess games (rapid, blitz, etc.), the Stonewall Attack can be played to good effect on its own, and typically much sooner compared to other, more heavily theory-laden Queen's Pawn openings.
Notable is lesson/chapter 4 of"The London System In 12 Practical Lessons"by Oscar de Prado(in my view currently the best and the most up-to-date book on the London System) which treats an alternative variation of the London System that I like to call the"London Stonewall Variation".This setup seeks to improve upon the standard Stonewall setup through White's early development and exchange of his the light-square f4-bishop prior to completing the Stonewall pawn structure (c3-d4-e3-f4).  As the author states:"The idea is that after Black's usual ...Bd6, White is going to play Bf4xd6, followed by f2-f4,setting up a version of the Stonewall, which in theory should be good for White since we've exchanged our theoretically bad bishop [Bf4] for the opponent's good one [Bd6].  [....]  This is a good alternative to have in your repertoire, varying it with the normal London System, so as to be able to surprise our opponents."
For examples of the"London Stonewall", see the following games....
Alekseev, Vadim-Sarichev, Sergey 1-0D00 RUS-Cup Minsk 2000
Moiseenko, Vadim-Truskavetsky,Alexandr 1-0 Yalos Rapid 2022
The Stonewall can also be played as Black...
Playing the Stonewall Dutch Defense as Black
Here GM Nikola Sedlak makes a convincing case for playing the Stonewall Dutch Defense in the preface to his book (below)...
https://www.qualitychess.co.uk/ebooks/PlayingtheStonewallDutch-excerpt.pdf
As afirst introductionto theStonewall Dutch Defense, I recommendMy First Chess Opening Repertoire for Blackby Vincent Moret (Chapter 9, pp. 141-177) which extensively treats this opening.  Moret provides excellent, detailed, step-by-step instruction in how to play the variation, appropriate for the novice thru intermediate player who has little-to-no prior experience with the Stonewall Dutch.
For those interested inplaying the Stonewall as Black, I also recommend the followingbooks(in the order presented, for those with no prior experience with this opening)...
Starting Out: The Dutch Defenceby Neil McDonald
Win with the Stonewall Dutchby Sverre Johnsen & Ivar Bern
Dutch Stonewallby Jacob Aagaard
Playing The Stonewall Dutchby Nikola Sedlak
The Diamond Dutchby Viktor Moskalenko
All of these books are good for their intended purpose and audience.  Neil McDonald's book is an excellent introductory overview of all of the Dutch Defense variations - Stonewall, Classical and Leningrad.  Johnsen & Bern is a comprehensive introduction to the Stonewall Dutch for all players.  Jacob Aagaard's book is a comprehensive introduction to the Stonewall Dutch, targeted primarily to experienced players.  Sedlak's book is an opening repertoire in the Stonewall Dutch Defense, targeted primarily to experienced players.  Moskalenko's book is a relatively advanced treatment of all three Dutch Defense variations, also intended for more experienced players - it includes a separate chapter on anti-Dutch systems.

TheStonewall Attackis achess openingcharacterized by White playing pawns to d4 and e3, bishop to d3, knight to d2, and then completing the Stonewall structure by playing pawns to c3 and f4. This set-up is usually achieved by a 1.d4 move order buttranspositionis also possible viaBird's Opening, 1.f4. The Stonewall Attack is asystem; White heads for a very specificpawn formation, rather than trying to memorize long lines of different variations. Black can set up in various ways in response, butMCO-15[1]gives the following as a main line: 1.d4 d5 2.e3 Nf6 3.Bd3 c5 4.c3 Nc6 5.f4.
The earliest recorded game to feature the Stonewall Attack would appear to have beenHoward StauntonvsJohn Cochrane, London, 1842. The first player to use the opening regularly, however, was theBostonmasterPreston Ware, who frequently opened 1.d4 2.f4 from 1876 to 1882. Employing this unusual move order Ware was often able to reach Stonewall type positions (although later players would usually precede f4 with moves such as e3, Bd3 and Nd2). Ware's greatest success with the opening was at the exceptionally strongVienna tournament of 1882where he defeated future world championWilhelm Steinitz.
In 1893Harry Nelson Pillsburyhad notable success with the Stonewall Attack during the two New York tournaments of that year, venturing the opening on six occasions and winning all six. After Pillsbury's success the Stonewall Attack became established in master play and appeared frequently in the games of American mastersJackson ShowalterandFrank Marshall, and English masterF.J. Lee. Other prominent players to have used the opening includedLasker,Capablanca,Alekhine,Chigorin,Rubinstein,Tarrasch,Reti,Tartakower,MaroczyandBreyer. By the early 1920s the Stonewall Attack began to disappear from top level chess, although it remains a popular choice at club level. The most notable modern day practitioner is AmericanIMYaacov Norowitz who has played the opening extensively in online blitz with considerable success.
The Stonewall set-up, when employed by Black, remains one of the main options within theDutch Defenceand has been used byMagnus Carlsento defeatViswanathan AnandandFabiano Caruana.
White's Stonewall pawn formation gives good control of the central dark squares (particularly e5, which may provide an outpost for a knight). The light squared weaknesses are covered by minor pieces (Bd3, Nd2). If permitted to do so, White may launch a direct kingside attack involving ideas such as Bxh7, Qh5 and Rf3-h3. A 1981 article in Chess Life magazine[2]gave the following line as an example of how play can develop if Black defends weakly.
While such primitive tactics cannot be expected to succeed against experienced chess players, the illustrative games below demonstrate that in the Stonewall's heyday White was often able to develop a dangerous initiative even against master level opposition.
The disadvantages of the Stonewall Attack are a rather inflexible pawn structure, long-term light square weaknesses and the 'bad bishop' on c1, constrained by White's own pawns.
