## Italian Game
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Italian-Game)
The Italian Game is one of the oldest openings in chess and has been around for centuries. This classical 1.e4 opening can lead to slower and positional games as well as open, tactical battles. Although very common among beginners, the Italian Game is a part of the repertoire of players of every level.
The Italian Game starts after the moves1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4.White develops their kingside pieces sensibly, with the knight controlling the center and the bishop attacking the weak f7-pawn through the central d5-square.
With this opening, White follows the basic opening principles of fighting for the center and taking care of the king's safety. From there, the game can evolve into either tactical or positional struggles.
As an opening that has been around since the 1500s, masters studied the Italian Game intensely throughout the ages. Below you can see the main variations of this opening.
The most popular variation of the Italian Game is the Giuoco Piano, which starts after1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5. The name of this line is an Italian expression that can translate to "soft game" or "slow game," an indication that this variation often leads to positional games. Despite its name, White can force a more open game by playing 5.d4 and entering the Center Attack variation.
The Giuoco Pianissimo, as the name suggests, tends to lead to a "very slow game." The d2-d3 push characterizes this variation and can happen either through1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.d3or through1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.c3 Nf6 5.d3. With this variation, White keeps the center closed and favors a more positional game.
Popularized by Captain W.D. Evans and used extensively by Paul Morphy, The Evans Gambit is suitable for the aggressive player. White gives up a wing pawn to develop quickly and create a dangerous attack on the enemy king. This variation adds spice to the slower Giuoco Piano after the moves1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.b4. Although not common at the highest levels, the Evans Gambit is one of the best-scoring lines among beginner and intermediate players.
The Italian Game is not one of the most challenging openings to deal with on Black's side.
The Black player who enjoys a positional game can count on the main lines of the Giuoco Piano for a balanced game. Black wins 31% of games, draws 33%, and loses 36% in this line—a more than satisfactory result. Note that if Black chooses this line, they should be prepared for the Evans Gambit.
Although Black can accept the gambit and still get a good game, the Evans Gambit Declined variation scores the best. With 41% of games ending in wins, 23% draws, and 36% losses, Black stands very well after1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.b4 Bb6. The Black player can also rejoice at the fact that this variation scores remarkably well among non-professional players.
The Italian Game is one of the oldest openings in chess, with Italian masters adopting and studying it as early as the 16th century. Notably, Giulio Cesare Polerio analyzed it in his codexes, Pedro Damiano in his 1512 Questo libro e da imparare giocare a scachi et de li partiti, and later Gioachino Greco in his manuscripts.
The opening remained popular throughout the ages, appearing consistently in top-level play. Nowadays, elite players like GMs Anish Giri, Wesley So, and Maxime Vachier-Lagrave are still employing the Giuoco Piano regularly with the white pieces.
As expected of an opening that survived for so long, there are several famous examples of the Italian Game. Below you can see four illustrative examples of this type of opening:
Anderssen vs. Dufresne, 1852 - The Evergreen Game
Steinitz vs. von Bardeleben, 1895
Carlsen vs. Nakamura, 2011
Kasparov vs. Lautier, 1994

TheItalian Gameis a family of chess openings beginning with the moves:
This opening is defined by thedevelopmentof the white bishop to c4 (the so-called "Italian bishop"), where it attacks Black's vulnerable f7-square. It is part of the large family ofOpen Gamesor Double King's Pawn Games.
The Italian Game is one of the oldest recorded chess openings; it occurs in theGöttingen manuscriptand was developed by players such asDamianoandPolerioin the 16th century, and later byGrecoin 1620, who gave the game its main line. It has been extensively analyzed for more than 300 years.
The termItalian Gameis sometimes used interchangeably withGiuoco Piano, although the latter also refers particularly to play after 3...Bc5.[1]
TheEncyclopaedia of Chess Openingsgives the Italian Game ten codes: C50–C54 for the Giuoco Piano, and C55–C59 for the Two Knights Defense. Side lines are covered under C50.
Black's two main options are 3...Bc5, theGiuoco Piano, and 3...Nf6, theTwo Knights Defense. They are about equally popular,[2]but the resulting positions usually have a very different character.
Until the 19th century, this line was the main line of the Italian Game. Dubbed theGiuoco Piano("Quiet Game") in contrast to the more aggressive lines then being developed, this continues 4.d3, the positionalGiuoco Pianissimo("Very Quiet Game"), or the main line 4.c3 (the original Giuoco Piano) leading to positions first analyzed by Greco in the 17th century, and revitalized at the turn of the 20th by the Moller Attack. 4.0-0 will usually transpose into the Giuoco Pianissimo after 4...Nf6 5.d3, while 4.Nc3 Nf6 is atranspositioninto theFour Knights Game.
Another option for White is the aggressiveEvans Gambit(4.b4), a popular opening in the 19th century which is still occasionally played. TheItalian Gambit(4.d4) may transpose into theScotch Gambitafter 4...exd4; however, this move order allows Black the option of 4...Bxd4, so if White wants a Scotch Gambit, 3.d4 is usually preferred. TheJerome Gambit(4.Bxf7+) is unsound.
3...Nf6 is the more aggressiveTwo Knights Defense. This is more in the nature of a counterattack, and some (e.g.Bronstein) have proposed it be renamed so.
If White attempts to exploit the weakness of Black's f7-pawn with 4.Ng5, Black may try the knife-edged Traxler/Wilkes-Barre Variation (4...Bc5!?). After the more common 4...d5 5.exd5, Black generally avoids 5...Nxd5 allowing 6.Nxf7, the Fegatello orFried Liver Attack, or 6.d4, theLolliVariation, both of which are difficult to defend under practical conditions. Most common is 5...Na5, sacrificing a pawn for an active position. The very sharp Fritz Variation (5...Nd4) and the closely related Ulvestad Variation (5...b5) lead to wild positions with little margin for error for either side.
Aquieteroption for White is 4.d3, when Black's main options are 4...Bc5, transposing into the Giuoco Pianissimo, and the solid 4...Be7, which is likely to lead to similar positions to theBishop's Opening.
Alternatively, White can play 4.d4, which may lead to theScotch Gambitafter the usual reply 4...exd4.
