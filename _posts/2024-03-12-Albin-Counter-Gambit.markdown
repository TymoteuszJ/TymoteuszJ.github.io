TheAlbin Countergambitis achess openingthat begins with the moves:
and the usual continuation is:
The opening is agambitand an uncommon response to theQueen's Gambit. In exchange for the sacrificed pawn, Black has a central wedge at d4 and gets some chances for an attack. Often White will try to return the pawn at an opportune moment to gain apositionaladvantage.
In theEncyclopaedia of Chess Openingsthe Albin Countergambit is assigned codes D08 and D09.
Although this opening was originally played by Cavallotti against Salvioli at theMilantournament of 1881,[1]it takes its name fromAdolf Albin, who played it againstEmanuel LaskerinNew York1893. Though it is not played frequently at the master level, RussiangrandmasterAlexander Morozevichmade some successful use of it in the 2000s.[2]
The main line continues 4.Nf3 Nc6 (4...c5 allows 5.e3 because Black no longer has the bishop check) and now White's primary options are 5.a3, 5.Nbd2, and 5.g3. Perhaps White's surest try for an advantage is tofianchettotheir light-squared (king-side) bishop with 5.g3 followed by Bg2 and Nbd2. Black will oftencastlequeenside. A typical continuation is 5.g3 Be6 6.Nbd2 Qd7 7.Bg2 0-0-0 8.0-0 Bh3.
The black pawn on d4 is stronger than it may appear. After 3.dxe5d4the careless move 4.e3?can lead to the Lasker Trap. After 4...Bb4+ 5.Bd2 dxe3!!(sacrificing the bishop) 6.Bxb4??is a blunderâ€”Black continues with 6...exf2+!7.Ke2 (7.Kxf2 does not work because of 7...Qxd1) 7...fxg1=N+!8.Rxg1 Bg4+!and Black wins the queen with a winning position. The Lasker Trap is notable because it features a rare instance of anunderpromotionin practical play.
In the Spassky Variation, White avoids the Lasker Trap by advancing 4.e4. Although Black can captureen passantwith 4...dxe3, the Lasker Trap depends on Black capturing the e-pawn after 4...Bb4+ 5.Bd2, which is not possible here. According toMinev, after 4.e4? Nc6! Black will have the better game.[3]
