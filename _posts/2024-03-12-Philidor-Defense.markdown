## Philidor Defense
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Philidor-Defense)
ThePhilidor Defenseis a passive but playable opening for Black, usually reached by the move order1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6. It is named after the 18th century French masterFrancois Philidor, who preferred 2...d6 to the more common alternative (then and now) of 2...Nc6.
The Philidor is defined by Black's second move, 2...d6. Although it is the third-most common move in the position, it is only played about 1/30th as often as 2...Nc6 and 1/3 as often as the Petroff Defense (2...Nf6). At the same time it is 10 times more popular than the #4 move, the Latvian Gambit (2...f5).
If you watch GMBenjamin Finegold's Chess.comLessons on the Philidor, he also teaches thealternative move order1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 e5.
White has two main responses to the Philidor, 3.d4 and 3.Bc4. Black generally responds to the first of those moves in one of three ways, not including Philidor's own move 3...f5, which is considered inferior today.
More than half of Philidor Defense games end up in this position, given the popularity of both 3.d4 and 3...exd4. After the typical continuation 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 Be7, White has several responses.
Nf6 is a typical move in any Philidor variation but can be played as early as move three, and is in fact the second most common try. Black's has its best results of any Philidor line if White plays the typical reply 4.Nc3, but White does very well playing 4.dxe5 instead.
3...Nd7 is the typical opening move of the Hanham Variation, which also includes the moves ...c6 and ...Be7. Black aims to develop naturally while controlling some central squares.
White can play 3.Bc4 to develop naturally while avoiding Black's main lines. Black must be careful not to end up in a trap known as Legal's Mate.
Against the Exchange Variation, 6.g3 and 6.Bf4 (win rate of 49% and 52%, respectively) score much better than 6.Be2 or 6.Bc4 (36% each). Against 3...Nf6 there is the 4.dxe5 line shown above for a 58% win rate for White. And the Hanham tends to do poorly against standard moves as below.
Although it wins at a slightly lower percentage than 3.d4, 3.Bc4 is seen far less often and so can have surprise value.
The Philidor Defense predates its namesake, with oneRuy Lopez de Seguragame on record as well as appearing four times in the writings ofGioachino Greco. Philidor analyzed and recommended it in his 1749 treatiseL’Analyse du jeu des Echecs. There are only a handful of records of Philidor playing the opening, but most of his games were not written down and lost to time.
The Philidor has had very few regular practitioners over the years. No world champions exceptAlexander Alekhinehave played it more than a handful of times, and sometimes seemingly by accident, such as when GMGarry Kasparovarrived in a Philidor position in 1979 by the move order 1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5 d6 3.Nc3 Nbd7 4.e4 e5. GMEtienne Bacrotis probably the best player to have used it somewhat often, making it part of his opening repertoire from 2003-05.
By far the most famous game in the Philidor Defense was a crushing defeat for Black against the star AmericanPaul Morphyin the famousOpera Game. However, Black's problems did not begin with the second move but rather the third, the weak 3...Bg4.
A young Alekhine showed how to win with the Philidor against careless play by White.
Although generally not recommended for high level players, the Philidor Defense is good for those who want to avoid main lines of the extensive theory that exists in the Ruy Lopez or Petroff. Visit theChess.com Explorerto play around with lines and move orders.

ThePhilidor Defence(orPhilidor's Defence) is achess openingcharacterised by the moves:
The opening is named after the famous 18th-century playerFrançois-André Danican Philidor, who advocated it as an alternative to the common 2...Nc6. His original idea was to challenge White'scentreby the pawn thrust ...f7–f5.
Today, the Philidor is known as asolidbut passive choice for Black, and is seldom seen in top-level play except as an alternative to the heavily analysed openings that can ensue after the normal 2...Nc6. It is considered a good opening for amateur players who seek a defensive strategy that is simpler and easier to understand than the complex positions that result from an opening such as theFrench Defence.
TheEncyclopaedia of Chess Openingscode for Philidor Defence is C41.
In his 1561 book,Ruy Lopez, seeking to debunkPedro Damiano, advocated 2...d6 as superior to 2...Nc6, on the grounds that 2...Nc6 allows the strong move 3.Bb5, now known as theRuy Lopezor Spanish Opening. Philidor evidently concurred with this assessment, though he also considered 2.Nf3 inferior to 2.Bc4. Philidor advocated the risky continuation 3.d4 f5!? The Philidor Defence subsequently became a popular opening, though 2...Nc6 remained the most common reply.
The Philidor occurred in one of the most famous games ever played,"The Opera Game"played in 1858 between the Americanchess masterPaul Morphyand two strong amateurs, the German nobleDuke Karl of Brunswickand the French aristocrat Count Isouard. The game continued 3.d4 Bg4, a deviation from modern standard lines. The Philidor Defence declined in popularity aspositional playbecame more developed, and it had almost completely vanished from top-tier chess byWorld War I.
As of 2017[update], there are no top players who employ the Philidor with regularity, althoughÉtienne BacrotandLiviu-Dieter Nisipeanuhave occasionally experimented with it in classical play. Its popularity in master play has increased slightly, however, over the last 20 years. It has also become fairly popular inrapid,blitz, andbullet chess.[1]
With 3.d4, White immediately challenges Black in thecentre. Black has several options.
The most common Black response is 3...exd4 which relieves the centraltension, although it gives up the centre. After 4.Nxd4 Nf6 (4...d5 5.exd5, thePaulsenAttack,[2]continues 5...Qxd5 6.Qe2+ Be7 7.Nb5 Na6 8.N1c3+/=Paulsen[3]) 5.Nc3, Black normally continues ...Be7 and ...0-0 (theAntoshin Variation) and achieves a strong defensive position. A sample line is: 5...Be7 6.Bc4 0-0 7.0-0 c5, and the position isequal.
In this line Black can alsofianchettohis bishop to g7, although this is uncommon.Bent Larsentried this in a few games, including adrawagainstMikhail Talin 1969.[4]
Instead of 4.Nxd4, White can play 4.Qxd4, as Paul Morphy favoured, intending 4...Nc6 5.Bb5 Bd7 6.Bxc6 Bxc6 7.Nc3 Nf6 8.Bg5 followed by 0-0-0. This line was played in many 19th-century games.
The other main option for Black is to maintain the central tension and adopt a setup with ...Nd7, ...Be7, and ...c6. This plan is named the Hanham Variation (after theAmericanchess masterJames Moore Hanham) and was favoured byAron Nimzowitsch. A common line is: 3...Nf6 4.Nc3 Nbd7 5.Bc4 Be7 6.0-0 (6.Ng5 is an interesting alternative: after 6...0-0 7.Bxf7+ Rxf7 8.Ne6 Qe8 9.Nxc7 Qd8 10.Nxa8, White is upmaterial, but Black can develop a stronginitiativeafter, for example, 10...b5 11.Nxb5 Qa5+) 6...0-0 7.a4 (to prevent ...b5) c6 (see diagram).
Grandmaster(GM)Larry Kaufmannotes that the Hanham Variation aims to maintain Black's pawn on e5, analogously to closed lines of theRuy Lopez, and opines that "it would be quite popular and on a par with the major defences to 1.e4, except for the annoying detail that Black can't actually reach the Hanham position by force."[5]
As an alternative to 4.Nc3 in response to Black's 3...Nf6, according to both Kaufman and GMChristian Bauer, White retains some advantage with: 4.dxe5!Nxe4 5.Qd5! (theRellstabVariation;[6]5.Nbd2 is theSokolskyVariation[7]) 5...Nc5 6.Bg5 Be7 7.exd6 Qxd6 8.Nc3.[8][9]
Black sometimes tries 3...Nd7 intending 4.Nc3 Ngf6, reaching the Hanham Variation. But then 4.Bc4! is awkward for Black to meet, since 4...Ngf6 loses to 5.dxe5 Nxe5 (5...dxe5??6.Ng5! wins) 6.Nxe5 dxe5 7.Bxf7+ Kxf7 8.Qxd8 Bb4+ 9.Qd2 Bxd2+ 10.Nxd2 winning a pawn, and 4...Be7 loses a pawn to 5.dxe5 Nxe5 (5...dxe5?? 6.Qd5! wins) 6.Nxe5 dxe5 7.Qh5![8][10]So 4...c6 is best for Black, but leaves White with the advantage of thebishop pairafter 5.0-0 Be7 6.dxe5 dxe5 (6...Nxe5 loses a pawn to 7.Nxe5 dxe5 8.Qh5) 7.Ng5! Bxg5 8.Qh5! Qe7 and now 9.Bxg5 or 9.Qxg5.[11]
In recent years, Black has experimented with othermove ordersin an attempt to reach the Hanham Variation while avoiding 3...Nf6 4.dxe5! and 3...Nd7 4.Bc4!
A more aggressive approach for Black after 3.d4 is 3...f5!?(diagram), Philidor's original intention and recommendation. In the 19th century, 3...f5 was also played byPaul Morphy. The move can lead to moreopen positionsthan the other lines, but is often considered dubious.[16][17]Others maintain that 3...f5 is a valid idea. GMTony Kostenconsiders the move respectable in his monograph on the opening.[18]The move was also played byDavid Bronsteinand byTeimour Radjabov.
After 3...f5 White has several ways to proceed:
Inferior is 3...Bg4?!, in light of 4.dxe5 Bxf3 (Black cannot recapture since 4...dxe5?5.Qxd8+ Kxd8 6.Nxe5 wins a clean pawn; or, Black can gambit a pawn with 4...Nd7, theAlbinVariation[34]) 5.Qxf3 (or White can obtain an endgame advantage with 5.gxf3 dxe5 6.Qxd8+ Kxd8 7.f4+/−Maróczy[35]) 5...dxe5 6.Bc4 giving White the advantage of thebishop pairin an open position as well as a largedevelopmentadvantage. Black cannot block the attack on the f7-pawn with the "natural" 6...Nf6? because White wins a pawn with 7.Qb3 (played in the famous "Opera Game", where Morphy as White refrained from taking the b7-pawn and retained a stronginitiativeafter 7...Qe7 8.Nc3). Black does better with 6...Qf6 7.Qb3 Bc5 8.0-0 Bb6 9.a4 a5 10.Nc3 Ne7 11.Be3 Nd7 12.Rad1+/−, or 6...Qd7!? (Maróczy).[35]
An alternative approach for White is 3.Bc4, delaying d2–d4, or forgoing it entirely, playing d2–d3 instead. The move 3.Bc4 is also White's route to a possibleLégal Trap. Some continuations:
Against the alternative 3.c3, Black can try 3...f5 (3...Nc6 4.d4 Nf6 transposes to thePonziani Opening) 4.exf5 Bxf5 5.Qb3 Nf6 6.Ng5 d5 7.Qxb7 Nbd7 8.Qc6 Bd6 withcompensationandinitiative.[38]
