TheThree Knights Gameis achess openingwhich most commonly begins with the moves:
In the Three Knights Game, Black chooses to break symmetry in order to avoid the main lines of what is often considered thedrawishFour Knights Gameafter the usual 3...Nf6.
The relevantECOcode is C46.
After tries such as 3...d6 or 3...Be7, White can play 4.d4, leaving Black with a cramped position resemblingPhilidor's Defense. If Black plays 3...Bc5 instead, White can eliminate Black's outpost at e5: 4.Nxe5!Nxe5 5.d4 Bd6 6.dxe5 Bxe5. Since tournament praxis shows the line seems to favor White, Black usually plays 3...Bb4 or 3...g6, theSteinitz Defense. Continuations then are typically 3...Bb4 4.Nd5 and 3...g6 4.d4 exd4 5.Nd5.
Another alternative for Black is 3...f5!?– theWinawer Defense(orGothic Defense). Then 4.Bb5 transposes into theSchliemann variationof theRuy Lopezwith 4.Nc3.
The Three Knights is almost never seen atmasterlevel nowadays, as Black players have sought more active tries, even within the Four Knights.
The similar position with Black having moved ...Nf6 is calledPetrov's Three Knights Game, although it too usually leads to the Four Knights Game.
