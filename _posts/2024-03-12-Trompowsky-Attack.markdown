## Trompowsky Attack
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Trompowsky-Attack)
The Trompowsky Attack is an offbeat 1.d4 opening for White as a response to Black's 1...Nf6. A newer opening, the Trompowsky is light on theory but still offers White good attacking chances. It also avoids some of the heavily theoretical lines of other openings. As such, it is a good opening for players of every level.
TheTrompowskyAttackstarts after the moves1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5. White develops their dark-squared bishop on the second move and attacks Black's knight. White immediately threatens to take the knight to damage Black's pawn structure. Black can either let White double their pawns or avoid it, as both lines are perfectly playable.
The Trompwoski is a good way for White to avoid a few lines against 1.d4 that are dense in theory. It's also a way for White to catch some Black players off guard. Although there are aggressive lines for White, there are also some very positional lines where White simply exchanges their dark-squared bishop and places their central pawns on dark squares with an extremely solid position. This approach is similar to some Torre Attack and London System setups. These options for White make it an attractive choice for players of all playing styles.
The Trompowsky Attack's theory is not nearly as large as 1.d4 openings such as the Queen's Gambit, King's Indian Defense, and others. Black's second move dictates much of the theory, as Black can either ignore White's threat or respond to it in various ways. Below you can see the main variations of the Trompowsky.
The most popular variation of the Trompowsky happens with the moves1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5 Ne4. Black "violates" an opening principle by moving the knight twice, knowing that White will have to waste a tempo of their own not to lose their bishop.

The second-most popular variation of the Tromposky occurs with the moves1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5 e6. Black's second move facilitates the development of their dark-squared bishop. It also avoids the doubling of the pawns on the f-file since the black queen defends the f6-knight.
The downside to Black's move is that White can immediately take more of the center with e2-e4.
After1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5 d5, Black ignores White's threat and expands in the center. White can transpose into the Veresov Attack (3.Nc3), the Torre Attack (3.Nf3), or stay in the Tromposky with 3.Bxf6. Black's will usually recapture with 3...exf6, when their doubled f-pawns make the kingside less flexible but also give Black more central space for their pieces.
White will usually develop their light-squared bishop with a fianchetto on g2 and attack the queenside or fight for the center immediately with c2-c4.
Another variation of the Tromposky begins after the moves1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5 c5. Black once again invites White to take their knight to double their pawns. White will usually take the knight, and Black will recapture with 3...gxf6, preparing to build a strong center. White can also ignore Black's tease and advance their d-pawn to try to cramp Black's position. These are some of the sharpest lines in this opening.
Black can also opt for the variation that starts after1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5 g6. Black again ignores White's attack on their knight and prepares to fianchetto their dark-squared bishop on g7. If White wants to stay in the Trompowsky, they'll usually take the knight and force Black to double their pawns.
Once more, White's plans will either revolve around developing their light-squared bishop on g2 and attacking the queenside or playing the c2-c4 push immediately.
The Trompowsky Attack is a relatively new opening and received its name after the 1939 Brazilian champion Octavio Trompowsky. He helped popularize this opening from the 1920s through the 1940s when he played it in numerous tournaments against strong grandmasters.
The opening gained traction during that period since the move 2.Bg5 caught many masters by surprise. In 1941, Trompowsky wrote that White's second move allowed him to "escape from the books and face masters more or less with equal weapons."
After the 1940s, masters have used the opening only sporadically. Curiously, from 1990 onward, the Tromposky had a resurgence in popularity. Notable players like GMAntoaneta Stefanovaoften play the opening, and even GMMagnus Carlsenused it against GMSergey Karjakinduring their 2016 world championship match.

TheTrompowsky Attack(orTrompowsky Opening, also known as theOpočenský Opening, theRuth Opening, and theZot) is achess openingthat begins with the moves:
White prepares toexchangethe bishop for Black's knight, inflictingdoubled pawnsupon Black in the process. This is not a lethal threat; Black can choose to fall in with White's plan.
The Trompowsky is a popular alternative to the more common lines after 1.d4 Nf6 beginning 2.c4 or 2.Nf3. By playing 2.Bg5, White sidesteps immense bodies ofopening theoryof variousIndian Defenceslike theQueen's Indian,King's Indian,Nimzo-Indian, as well as theGrünfeld Defence.
The opening is named after the one-time Brazilian championOctávio Trompowsky(1897–1984) who played it in the 1930s and 1940s.[1]Chess masterKarel Opočenský(1892–1975) also played it in the 1930s, and the opening is also known as the Opočenský Opening.[2]Also,chess masterWilliam Allen Ruth developed the opening simultaneously in the 1930s, and it was well-known by locals in Pennsylvania as the Ruth Opening. The Trompowsky has also been called the Zot.
Julian Hodgson,Antoaneta Stefanova, andArjun Erigaisiare among severalgrandmasterswho often employ the Trompowsky. World ChampionMagnus Carlsenhas occasionally employed the Trompowsky, notably in the first game of the2016 World Chess ChampionshipagainstSergey Karjakin.
Black has a number of ways to meet the Trompowsky, some of which avoid doubled pawns, while others allow them. The most common Black responses are discussed here.
White can also play 2.Bg5 after 1.d4 d5. This is known as the Pseudo-Trompowsky,Hodgson Attack, Levitsky Attack, Queen's Bishop Attack, and Bishop Attack, and is covered inECOcode D00. Play transposes to the Trompowsky if Black plays 2...Nf6.
