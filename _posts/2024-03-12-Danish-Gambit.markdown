## Danish Gambit
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Danish-Gambit)
The Danish Gambit is an aggressive 1.e4 e5 opening for White. This opening is well-suited for aggressive players who don't mind sacrificing pawns for the initiative. Although it is rare in master-level play, the Danish Gambit can be a fun and playable opening for club-level players.
The Danish Gambit starts with the moves1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.c3. White attacks Black's only central pawn and offers a pawn sacrifice for quick development.
White's third move aims to develop their pieces quickly, while Black moves their pawn repeatedly. If Black is careless, White can also recapture the black d4-pawn and build a strong center.
There are three main variations of the Danish Gambit. Black either accepts or declines the pawn sacrifice. If Black accepts the gambit, White can choose one of two main variations.
The most popular variation in case Black accepts the gambit is1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Bc4. White offers yet another pawn to develop even quicker, putting pressure on Black's f7-pawn.
If Black takes the b2-pawn, White develops their other bishop with 4.Bxb2, putting even more pressure on Black's kingside.
White can also play the Danish Gambit Accepted by recapturing the pawn on c3 with1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3. This move recaptures the pawn and develops the queenside knight to a natural square, from where it attacks the center.
Although slightly more conservative than the line with 3.Bc4, this line is also dangerous for Black if they don't know what to do. White is a pawn down but has a lead in development. White also enjoys open lines for all their minor pieces, while Black is severely underdeveloped.
Black can also refuse the pawn sacrifice and play a safer game with the moves1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.c3 d5. With this move, Black ignores the hanging pawn to open lines for their own pieces. The black pawn on d5 also attacks White's undefended pawn on e4.
The game usually continues with White capturing the d5-pawn. From there, point Black can recapture with4...Qxd5, since White can't gain a tempo developing their knight to c3, or develop their knight with4...Nf6.
The Danish Gambit was first analyzed by a Danish player called Blankensteiner in 1830. Later, another Dane player further popularized the opening by employing it in the international tournament of Paris in 1867.
Later, players likeAlexander Alekhine,Joseph Henry Blackburne, andFrank Marshallused the opening. However, the gambit fell in popularity around the 1920s, when more players learned how to defend with Black.
Nowadays, the opening is rare among the chess elite. Yet, you can still see aggressive players employing the Danish Gambit at lower levels.
