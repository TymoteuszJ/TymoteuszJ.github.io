nakhmanson gmabit is here!!
I really like the Nakhmanson Gambit, as it's really easy to learn, and you just have so much potential. With perfect play by black, it is a draw though, but they have to play computer moves, and even Stockfish 12 can't beat/draw it! I recently made a video on this, and you can find it right over here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2n8TAR69EyY
with perfect play by black it is a draw?
After Nxc3 and d5, black has a safe advantage with no risk.
There are some reasons that almost no books mention it...
White has some compensations for the pawn, but really less than many other gambits...
Keep analyzing, or see the video, it's fine for white.
lol, just to be curious (and bcoz i have time to waste), let's go watching a video made by a kid, advocated here by a 1600...
I'm just interested in Nxc3 line, I don't want to go into trash and let's see what he proposes at about 10'30...
"This... (hesitation here) is gonna be a draw". He doesn't look so sure and well, with black playing easy moves (yes there are quite easy to find because natural), we are pawn up for almost no compensation for white.
All endgames a pawn down are draw? I have some doubts...
Gonna be a draw? Perhaps. If white just begins with pawn down, we can be sure he/she will not be able to defend accurately so far from a draw.
And that's all he says about Nxc3, lol. Less than 1 min about the line to play for black, with a ridiculous evaluation (he admits he would prefer black thought), when 14 min spent with trash lines that all players with black and some good sense would avoid.
Next stupid gambit?
Where does the nameNakhmanson came from? GM Sokolov played this in 1960's and Yakov Neishtadt commenting one of the games say that this move comes from GM Esteban Canal.
In factYakov Neishtadt classifies as 6.Nc3? the move played by Sokolov in 1966.
Isn’t dxc3 losing for black. I’m pretty sure that nxc3 gives black a easy edge, but maybe not winning.
Actually, in the Nxc3 line given above, I'm very surprised that stockfish just gives 0.00.

I don't know which Stockfish u use and how but mine gives almost -1 for black...
I used 12 on chessbase
Maybe 10... Bd6 or 10... Qd6 is an improvement. Or your 7... Be7 may be best. It doesn't matter anyways from an opening perspective since white is the one trying to equalize and he's already worst, but just to be as accurate as possible with black.
Nahkmanson is bad tho this is better
I like how Chess_Night5030 argues with an IM, and is using a worthless youtube video as a basis for an argument. The guy is hilarious.
Yes I think your right about Bd6 being better than f6 on move 12, White seems to be strugling to equalise. But, do you think that black could gain even a bigger edge with 10... Bd6 or 7... Be7.
I'm not sure how good my analysis is, but it seems like black's edge is pretty small in these lines. I'm inclined to believe that the most challenging moves (in 6... Nxc3) is rather 7... Be7 or 10... Bd6.
yup you are right
Well I'm not 100% sure about my analysis (I didn't use high depth stockfish), but I definitely changed my mind about dxc3, it's more complicated then thought and Nxc3 gives a decent edge in most lines.
Wow, a nice sharp gambit!
It might be better for black if you accept the knihgt sacrifice, but you have to found some difficult moves over the board, which is not that simple as you can slip very easily.
