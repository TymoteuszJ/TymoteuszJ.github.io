## Latvian Gambit
# Content [from](https://www.chess.com/openings/Kings-Pawn-Opening-Latvian-Gambit)
TheLatvian Gambitis an aggressive opening that Black can try against 1.e4. Although usually not seen in master games, this opening is playable among club-level players due to its many tactical traps.
The Latvian Gambit starts with the moves1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f5. Black offers not one but two pawns right on their second move. White can take either the e- or the f-pawn, and Black's idea is to eventually strive for better center control. Usually, a tactical slugfest follows, with both sides having to play sharp chess to come out on top.
Objectively speaking, White has a better position after Black enters the Latvian Gambit.
White can either accept or decline the gambit, although accepting it is the best way to refute Black's opening. White concedes equality for Black by declining the gambit, in which games Black even has the better score among masters.
The most challenging way for White to meet Black's opening is by accepting the gambit with1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f5 3.Nxe5. White takes Black's pawn and threatens the immediate 4.Qh5+, which can be devastating. Because of this threat, Black usually responds with the exotic-looking3...Qf6or with3...Nc6.
From there, a complicated game usually follows, with Black trying to keep a pawn in the center and both sides making tactical threats.
The other way to accept the gambit is with1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f5 3.exf5, though this variation is less challenging than 3...Nxe5. In a way, Black gets what they want by diverting the white pawn from the center. From there, Black can play aggressively with 3...e4, attacking the enemy knight. Another option is to play 3...d6, supporting their e-pawn and hoping to recapture White's f5-pawn while developing the light-squared bishop.
The Greco Variation of the Latvian Gambit starts after1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f5 3.Nxe5 Qe7. While this is not the best or most-played option for Black, it is a very old move, made famous by Italian masterGiochino Grecoin the 1600s. Black invites White to play 4.Qh5+ in the hopes of winning an exchange. White can go for the check and even win the exchange, but must be careful with a few traps Black can play to turn the game around.
Below, you can see two games played by Greco in this variation:
The most common way of declining the gambit is with1. e4 e5 2.Nf3 f5 3.Bc4, the Mayet Attack. While the engine claims equality, Black scores better in this variation. This is because White's idea of attacking the f7-square leads nowhere, and White does not have the time to exploit the weak h5-e8 diagonal.
The Latvian Gambit is one of the oldest chess openings recorded in history, being analyzed byPedro Damianoas early as 1512. A century later, another famous chess master, Greco, used this opening in a few beautiful games—giving the opening its other name, the Greco Counter-Gambit.
Around the 1900s, a few notable Latvian players, likeAron Nimzowitsch, popularized the opening even further. From then on, the opening was renamed the Latvian Gambit.
While there are some games where Black employs the Latvian Gambit to defeat well-known names like a young GMBobby Fischer, it's rare to see masters playing it. However, club players still adopt this opening to this day, despite its dubious reputation.

TheLatvian Gambit(orGreco Countergambit) is achess openingcharacterised by the moves:
It is one of the oldest chess openings, having been analysed in the 16th century byGiulio Cesare Polerioand then the 17th century byGioachino Greco, after whom it is sometimes named. The opening has the appearance of aKing's Gambitwithcolours reversed. It is an aggressive but objectively dubious opening for Black which often leads to wild and tricky positions.[1][2]FIDE Master Dennis Monokroussos even goes so far as to describe it as "possibly the worst opening in chess".[3]WhilePaul van der Sterrenobserves:
What is required to play the Latvian Gambit with any degree of success is a sharp eye for tactics and a mental attitude of total contempt for whatever theory has to say about it.
The Latvian is, and has always been, uncommon in top-levelover-the-boardplay, but somecorrespondenceplayers are devotees.[2][4]
TheECOcode for the Latvian Gambit is C40 (King's Knight Opening).
The opening was originally known as theGreco Countergambit, and some modern writers still refer to it as such.[5]That name recognised the Italian playerGioachino Greco(1600–1634), who contributed to the early theory of the opening. The nameLatvian Gambitis a tribute to severalLatvianplayers who analysed it,Kārlis Bētiņšbeing the most prominent among them. The AustrianInternational Master(IM)Albert Beckeronce published an article that Bētiņš judged to be dismissive about the Latvian Gambit. In response, Bētiņš published and analysed one of his own games in order to defend the gambit: Ilyin-Zhenevsky vs K Bētiņ, 1921.
According to most, the opening's only advantage is its ostensible novelty value, since, irrespective of what level you play at, the chances of your opponent even knowing this opening, let alone knowing the best lines for White, are low. However, it has been used byBoris Spassky[6]andMikhail Chigorin,[7]amongst many others; albeit, usually in casual play. Most notably, evenBobby Fischer[8]andJosé Raúl Capablanca[9]have lost to it. Sweden'sJonny Hectoris one of the fewgrandmastersto play it in serious competition; he has argued that it is not as bad as its reputation and that even with best play White's advantage is not large.[10]
White's 3.Nxe5 is considered the main line against the Latvian. After the usual 3...Qf6, the traditional main line has been 4.d4 d6 5.Nc4 fxe4, however recently the immediate 4.Nc4 (theLeonhardtVariation) has become popular.
4.Nc4 has the advantage of allowing White to open thecentrewith d3, for example 4...fxe4 5.Nc3 Qg6?! 6.d3 exd3? 7.Bxd3 Qxg2? and now White is winning after 8.Qh5+ Kd8 (or 8...g6 9.Qe5+ and 10.Be4) 9.Be4. If 6... Bb4, however, White must be careful following the same line, e.g. 7.Bd2 exd3 8.Bxd3 Qxg2 9.Qh5+ Kd8 10.Be4 Nf6! because now if White plays Bg5, which would be necessary to win the queen in the earlier line, then ...Bxc3+ wins for Black. The main line continues 5...Qf7 6.Ne3! Black usually responds with 6...c6!?, when White can either accept thepawnsacrificewith 7.Nxe4 d5 8.Ng5 Qf6 9.Nf3, or decline it with the more popular 7.d3 exd3 8.Bxd3 d5 9.0-0.[11]The latter variation has been deeply analysed; the BritishgrandmasterAnthony Kostenanalyses one line to move 32.[12]One line discussed by IMJeremy Silmanis 9...Bc5 10.Na4 Bd6 11.c4 d4 12.Nc2 c5 13.b4 Ne7 14.Nxc5 Bxc5 15.bxc5 Nbc6 16.Bb2 0–0 17.Nxd4 Nxd4 18.Bxd4 Bf5 19.Bxf5 Nxf5 20.Be3 Qxc4 21.Qb3 Nxe3!? 22.fxe3 Rxf1+ 23.Rxf1 Qxb3 24.axb3 Rc8 25.Rf5 and now 25...Rd8 or 25...Rc6 gives Black an excellent chance todrawthe pawn-downendgame.[13]Silman later argued that 10.b4!! and now 10...Bxb4 11.Ncxd5 cxd5 12.Nxd5 or 10...Bd6 11.Re1! Ne7 12.Nexd5 cxd5 13.Nb5 is close to winning for White, and that the "old, discredited" 9...Bd6 (rather than 9...Bc5) might be Black's best try, though still insufficient forequality.[14]
A possible continuation after 4.d4 is 4...d6 5.Nc4 fxe4 6.Nc3 Qg6 7.f3 exf3 8.Qxf3 Nf6 9.Bd3 Qg4 10.Qe3+ Qe6 11.0-0 Qxe3+ 12.Bxe3 Be7 13.Rae1 0-0. White is better here, but Black has chances due to White's misplaced king and weak light squares.
Also possible is the eccentric 3...Nc6?!, against whichJohn Nunnrecommends 4.d4, preferring principled opening play to the unclear tactics resulting from 4.Qh5+. After 4.d4, if 4...Qh4? (Kosten's original recommendation) 5.Nf3! Qxe4+ 6.Be2 leaves Black with a lost position.[15]After 4.d4, Kosten analyses 4...Qf6!? 5.Nc3 Bb4 6.exf5! Nxe5 7.Qe2.[16]
Instead of 4.d4, Kosten says that White can accept the proffered rook with 4.Qh5+ g6 5.Nxg6 Nf6 6.Qh3 hxg6 7.Qxh8 Qe7 (7...fxe4? 8.d4! is strong) 8.d3! (Stefan Bücker gives an alternative 8.Nc3! Nb4 9.d3 as also winning for White)[17]8...fxe4 9.Be3 d5 10.Bc5! Qxc5 11.Qxf6 Bf5 12.dxe4 Nd4 13.exf5! Nxc2+ 14.Kd1 Nxa1 15.Bd3 Qd6 16.Re1+ Kd7 17.Qf7+ Be7 18.Re6 winning.[18]
White's 3.Bc4 may lead to perhaps the most notorious and heavily analysed line of the Latvian, which begins 3...fxe4 4.Nxe5 Qg5 5.d4 Qxg2 6.Qh5+ g6 7.Bf7+ Kd8 8.Bxg6! Qxh1+ 9.Ke2 Qxc1 (9...c6 is a major alternative) 10.Nf7+ Ke8 11.Nxh8+ hxg6 12.Qxg6+ Kd8 13.Nf7+ Ke7 14.Nc3! (diagram).[19]
Instead of 4...Qg5, however, "nowadays players often give preference to 4...d5", the Svedenborg[20]or Polerio[21]Variation. According to Latvian Gambit experts Kon Grivainis and John Elburg, Black wins more often than White in this line.[22]After 4...d5 5.Qh5+ g6 6.Nxg6, Black chooses between 6...Nf6 and 6...hxg6. 6...Nf6 usually leads, after 7.Qe5+ Be7 8.Bb5+! (a smallzwischenzugto deprive Black's knight of the c6-square) 8...c6 9.Nxe7 Qxe7 10.Qxe7+ Kxe7 11.Be2 (or 11.Bf1), to an endgame where Black is a pawn down but has positionalcompensation.[23]Sharper is 6...hxg6, when 7.Qxh8 Kf7 9.Qd4 Be6 gives White a largematerialadvantage, but his "position is constantly on the edge of a precipice", and the line has accordingly fallen out of favour.[24]More often, White plays 7.Qxg6+ Kd7 8.Bxd5 Nf6, leading to sharp andunclearplay.[25]
Black's best response is 3...fxe4. Some sample continuations are
Assessment: Black is usually down material, but has excellent compensation. Most of White's pieces are still on the back rank. IM Mio argues Black is better.[26]
Several other responses for White have been analysed.[27]
White's 3.Nc3 was originally analysed by the AmericanmasterStasch Mlotkowski(1881–1943) in the 1916British Chess Magazine.[28]Kosten gives as Black's two main responses 3...Nf6 4.Bc4 (4.exf5 is also possible) fxe4 5.Nxe5 d5 6.Nxd5! Nxd5 7.Qh5+ g6 8.Nxg6! hxg6! 9.Qxg6+ Kd7 10.Bxd5 Qe7 11.Qxe4 Rh4 12.Qxe7+ Bxe7, reaching anendgamewhere White has four pawns for aminor piece, and 4...fxe4 5.Nxe5 Qf6, when White can choose from 6.Nc4! (transposing to the main line 3.Nxe5 Qf6 4.Nc4 fxe4 6.Nc3), 6.d4, and 6.f4!?[29]Black can also play 3...d6, when 4.d4transposesto thePhilidor Countergambit(1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 f5!?), which was favoured byPaul Morphyin the mid-19th century and is still seen occasionally today.[28][30]
Today, however, Black's response is considered to be 3...fxe4.
Assessment: One of the best lines for Black. Black has better bishops and a strong centre.
White's 3.exf5 followed by 3...e4 4.Ne5 Nf6 5.Be2 is recommended byJohn L. WatsonandEric Schiller.[31]4.Qe2, 4.Nd4, and even 4.Ng1!? are also possible.[32]
Black's response should be 3...e4.
Now, White has three possible moves:
Sample Continuation #1 4.Ne5 Nf6 5.Be2 d6 6.Bh5+ Ke7! 7.Nf7 Qe8 8.Nxh8 Nxh5 9.Nc3 Kd8
Sample Continuation #2 4.Nd4 Nf6 5.d3 c5 6.Nb3 exd3 7.Bxd3 d5 8.Bb5+ Nc6
Common mistake 4.Qe2?Qe7 5.Nd4 Nc6 6.Qh5+ Kd8 7.Nxc6+ dxc6 8.Be2 Nf6 9.Qg5 h6 10.Qe3 Bxf5 11.0-0 Nd5 12.Qd4 Qd6 13.d3 Nb4
Assessment: While Black is not lost here, this variation is hard to play for Black. It often involves Ke7, allowing Nf7 and saccing the kingside rook.
White's 3.d4 followed by 3...fxe4 4.Nxe5 Nf6 5.Bg5 d6 leads, as usual, to sharp play. White often offers a piecesacrificewith either 6.Nc3!? or 6.Nd2!?, but Black seems to have adequate resources against both.[33]
Black's best response is considered to be 3...fxe4.
Sample Continuation #1 4.Nxe5 Nf6 5.Be2 d6 6.Nc4 Be6 7.Ne3 d5 8.c4 c6 9.Nc3 Be7 10.0-0 0-0
Common mistake  8.O-O?c5!
Sample Continuation #2 4.Nxe5 Nf6 5.Be2 d6 6.Ng4 Be7 7.Nc3 d5 8.Ne5 O-O 9.Bg5 c6 10.O-O Bf5
Assessment: Black has a better pawn structure, and better bishops. Few openings give you such a good position after just 10 moves.
This passive move does not promise White any advantage. After 3...Nc6 4.Nc3 Nf6 5.exf5 d5, Black is okay. Alternatively, 3...d6 4.Nc3 Nf6 5.g3 Be7 6.Bg2 is also considered a prudent defense by Black.[34]Black's best response is 3...Nc6.
Sample continuation #1 4.Nc3 Nc6 5.exf5 d5
Sample continuation #2 4.Nc3 Nc6 5.Bg5 Bb4 6.exf5 d5 7.a3 Bxc3+ 8.bxc3 Bxf5
Assessment: Normal position that is comparable to several other openings. White has a weak pawn structure but the bishop pair. However, this is a tough advantage to prove, since White's light-squared bishop is restricted.
